Tuscany is focusing on community building In the last quarter we have released, with the Incubator PMC's permission, milestone versions of both the Java and C++ runtimes and have used those to attract developers to the community. Since the last report we have voted in five new committers, Raymond Feng, Brent Daniel, Kelvin Goodson, Meeraj Kunnumpurath and Andrew Borley and have other people actively contributing. However, the majority of committers are still employed by one company and additional effort is being made to attract independent developers.There has been a significant change in the OSOA specification effort with the availability of a public website intended to provide additional transparency. We have confirmation that specification work is done under an agreement that explicitly states that such work is not confidential.Plan for the next quarter is to diversify the community. We do not believe there are any issues that require the attention of the board.
