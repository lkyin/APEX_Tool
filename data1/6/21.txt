Sketches are small, stateful programs that process massive data as a stream and can provide approximate answers, with mathematical guarantees, to computationally difficult queries orders-of-magnitude faster than traditional, exact methods.DataSketches has been incubating since 2019-03-30.Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:.Finish code migration.Set up automated builds.Establish code review practices.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of.No.How has the community developed since the last report?.We are still in the process of setting up permissions and figuring out Apache environment.How has the project developed since the last report?.Most DataSketches repos have been moved to Apache repos.How would you assess the podling's maturity?.Please feel free to add your own commentary.
