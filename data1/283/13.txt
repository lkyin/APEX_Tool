iPMC Reviewers: jukka, jimLokahi is a configuration and management console for Apache httpd, tomcat and other web server infrastructure.Incubating since: 2006-01-07.Several members of the Lokahi community attended Apachecon EU in an effort to grow the community. A FastFeather track on what Lokahi does and what it currently supports (slides are available here:http://people.apache.org/~toback/presentations/Lokahi-fast-feather-05-04-2007.pdf Specific outreach was made to the Geronimo community to help us get a sense of what it would take to have Lokahi control the Geronimo stack. A significant number of committers from other projects have subscribed to lokahi-dev over ApacheCon after discovering how this project could solve their own infrastructure headaches or how it could be enhanced to support their project's configuration and management. An initial roadmap of features has been planned, and development will be moving in the direction of the new roadmap. An initial draft of Lokahi's data model for the proposed switch to a Jackrabbit back-end was worked out with input from Jackrabbit community.The conversion to JCR takes first priority because it will mitigate existing difficulties that hinder community-growing, namely:.(a) Oracle as db requirement, which reduces the potential user "market"; (b) inability to run Lokahi on a standalone machine, due to (a); (c) complicated build process, partially due to (a);.JCR will provide the following benefits:.(a) database independence (run Lokahi with a file system backend to try it out, or use a more robust storage platform for production) + embedded Derby db (b) lower barrier to contribution, see (a) (c) versioned objects the basis for storing versioned configuration files & foundation for a future "undo" feature requested by users. Great for real-world use in regulated environments which require detailed audit trails of who-changed-what-and-when.Obstacles to graduation:.community - now includes authors outside of the original dev community, but additional committers are sought. Recent distractions reinforced the fact that a larger committer base is needed to graduate.licensing - oracle-only backend is now 90% of the way to an alternate MySQL backend, and soon to be enhanced with license agnostic interfaces.
