At least one Any23 incubating release.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC), Tika PMC, or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.Yes, all of the code has been ported from Google Code to the ASF. Thanks to Daniel Shahaf and Michele Mostarda for .leading the charge here.How has the community developed since the last report?.All ASF karma has been granted on the repository, and we've received a few JIRA issues, but not from outside.the core set of PPMC members as of yet. The team needs to respond to Paolo Castagna's points regarding RDF.frameworks and collaboration, and will hopefully do so this month. .How has the project developed since the last report?.Any23 was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on October 1, 2011.We have Jenkins CI builds going thanks to Lewis John McGibbney, code up and running at the ASF thanks to Michele.and to Daniel, so we're all set to really get kicking!.Signed off by mentor: mattmann.
