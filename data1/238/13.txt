iPMC Reviewers: dims, jerenkrantz, yoavs, jukka, twlTuscany provides infrastructure for developing service-oriented applications based on the OSOA specifications for Service Component Architecture (SCA) and Service Data Objects (SDO.Since our last report Tuscany has voted in one new committer, Simon Laws, but community diversity remains an issue with most contributors working for a single company.The Incubator PMC approved the M2 release of the Java SCA, SDO and DAS components and development continues apace. There is some significant restructuring and modularization the Tuscany Java code base underway, particularly related to SCA, the goal being to simplify the Tuscany build and release process and provide support for an upcoming version of the SCA specification. This instability is causing some tension in the community but is being worked through on the lists.For its next M3 release the Tuscany C++ runtime is being renamed to Tuscany Native to reflect its support for various other language platforms such as PHP, Ruby and Python.The ability to participate in the OSOA collaboration has been demonstrated with a project member who is not an employee of one of the vendors being able to contribute to the process.iPMC questions / comments:.JE: OSOA?.ant: OSOA is the collaboration group where the SCA specs are currently being developed, see: http://www.osoa.org.
