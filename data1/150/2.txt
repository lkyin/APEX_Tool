Logging for C++.log4cxx2 has been incubating since 2013-12-09.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. We probably need to decide what's an acceptable platform/compiler list,. sort out any remaining hiccups, and then move towards a release. 2. We need to release 0.11.0 as maintenance release. 3. We need to make a broader use of the ASF infrastructure (notably the. CI, as well as improved management of the Jira site - notably with. triaging), and establish a roadmap for the next releases.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. N/A.How has the community developed since the last report?. The committers are still getting acquainted with each other and the. foundation.

We have applied a lot of bug fixes which were collected in the last. years in JIRA and fit to a maintenance release, tested on different. platforms and started to discuss about changes in the used build. system because of different problems.Date of last release:. 2008-04-03 was the official, pre-incubation 0.10.0. Many post-0.10.0 commits exist on trunk which we intend to get out as. 0.11.x.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?. N/A.Signed-off-by:. (log4cxx2) Christian Grobmeier.
