HCatalog is a table and storage management service for data created using.Apache Hadoop. HCatalog entered Apache incubator in March 2011.What has the project accomplished since the last report?. - Released version 0.4. - Voted in one new committer. - Received patches from 19 people. In March 2012, HCatalog was identified as having low diversity. With the. addition of the new committer there are now 9 committers from 3 organizations. Additionally, we have received patches from 19 unique people (including. committers) some of which are outside the committer organizations. We believe. the low diversity issue has either been addressed, or good progress has been. made towards addressing the issue.What are the top 2-3 things to resolve before graduation?. - Grow the user community. There has been progress in this area with new. users asking questions on the mailing list, receiving patches from an]. increasing number of contributors, and work towards publishing pre-built. artifacts in the Apache repository. We need to continue in this positive. direction. - Resolve a review process issue that affects our ability to develop new. features. Time between receiving patches and committing has increased to. problematic levels, often causing code rot and contributors extra work to. rebase patches against trunk. At this time we feel confident in our ability to make progress toward. resolving these issues.Signed-off-by: gates, wave.
