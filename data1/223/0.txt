Subversion entered the Incubator on November 7, 2009.Discussions have been occurring on general@incubator with respect to graduation requirements, and some options for the podling's mailing lists and location in the main ASF Subversion repository. In addition, a number of discussions have been occurring on Subversion's developer mailing list ( dev@subversion.tigris.org ) regarding the mailing lists (migration, shut down, target address, etc), repository choices and location, which bug tracker to use, website migration, and the buildbot system(s.INFRA-2321 has been opened to track the code migration, and is scheduled for the afternoon (EST) of Sunday, November 15th.INFRA-2324 has been opened to construct the core five mailing lists for the Subversion podling: dev@, users@, commits@, private@, and announce@. These mailing lists will be built on the subversion.apache.org hostname. While this is non-standard for a podling, discussion on general@incubator has raised no issues with it. We will later backfill archives for these lists with the content from their equivalents on subversion.tigris.org.The software grant from Subversion Corporation was filed in ASF records on November 14.Many Subversion developers have been sending ICLAs into the ASF. An initial batch of eighteen account requests has been sent to root. There are fifteen(warning) Subversion committers who already had accounts at the ASF, and they will simply be added to the authorization file for the Subversion repository.The project has an initial status file in place, and its checklist items are being worked through. The podling is hoping that it can complete its work in time to place a TLP resolution on the December Board meeting's agenda.Signed off by mentor: Greg Stein, Daniel Rall, Sander Striker.
