Celix is an OSGi like implementation in C with a distinct focus on.interoperability between Java and C.Celix has been incubating since 2010-11-02.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:.1. We believe Celix is ready for graduation, the only thing left is making.sure all project metadata and (administrative) tasks are up to date.2. Nothing.3. Nothing.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware.of?.None.How has the community developed since the last report?.Since the last report Celix has gained two committers (Bjorn & Erik),.making the Celix community more diverse. Also a 1.0.0 release has been.released. Combined we believe that Celix is ready for graduation. One.downside is that in the last month activity on Celix mailinglist has been.slow, but we expect some increase in activity when we start graduation.How has the project developed since the last report?.Two donations were mades and added to Celix. A shared memory implementation.for remote services and the an implementation of the event admin.specification. The event admin implementation was done in a GSoC project.And a 1.0.0 release, focussing on stability, has been made.Date of last release:.2014-02-24.2012-12-16.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?.2014-03-04 Erik Jansman elected as committer.2014-01-08 Bjoern Petri elected as committer.2013-01-07 Roman Shaposhnik joins as a mentor.2012-03-20 Pepijn elected as committer.Signed-off-by:.

I don't see any particular cause for concern. Celix might need to.update the project site to reflect recent additions of the committers.
