Signed-off-by:. (mxnet) Sebastian Schelter. Comments:. (mxnet) Suneel Marthi. Comments:. Its been 4 months since this project has been proposed for Apache. Incubator and so far nothing's been done to move the project to Apache. All activity is still happening on the original project github -. http://github.com/dmlc/mxnet and all conversations still happen on the. project's Gitter channel. Since the last report from March 2017 (which. btw was drafted and filed by me) there's been ZERO traction on moving. the project to Apache. There are upcoming talks in various confs like -. https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny/public/schedule/detail/58186. that make no reference to the fact that the project is now 'Apache'. The reason me and Hen have not filed a report yet for April 2017 is due. to the fact we would rather one of the committers on the project took. the initiative to do it as opposed to a mentor covering for the. project.
