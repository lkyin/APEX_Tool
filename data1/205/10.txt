IPMC reviews: jukka.Sanselan has been in incubation since September 2007.Sanselan is a pure-java image library for reading and writing a variety of image formats.The community hasn't grown much in the past three months. There continues to be only one active committer.There was work on EXIF metadata read/write support and a bug in the implementation was discussed on the dev aliaas.Builds outside Apache have been made but no official Apache release has been created yet.Barriers to graduation continue to be diversity, size of the community, overall activity, and lack of a release from Apache.
