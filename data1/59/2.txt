(apex) Ted Dunning.Shepherd/Mentor notes:. Chris Nauroth (cnauroth):. The community continues to show great, open development activity on the. mailing list. The first release was handled well with careful attention. to detail when IPMC members requested a second RC with some changes. I. would like to request that the infra team prioritize completion of the. JIRA migration tracked in INFRA-10144. Alan Gates (gates):. There have been some questions regarding which committers in the project. are also on the PPMC. Originally only 6 developers were proposed for. initial committers, but as part of the entry to incubation this was. expanded to the current 30+. The understanding of some in the project. was that the PPMC still only consisted of those original 6, while the. other ~24 devs were just committers. The mentors have explained that it. does not work this way. The community is talking through how to. approach this disconnect. The mail thread is at. http://s.apache.org/qsV>.
