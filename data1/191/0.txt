Pivot is an open-source platform for building rich internet applications in Java.Pivot was accepted into incubation on the 26 January 2009.The Pivot community missed the last report, largely due to after acceptance a period of 'no action' ensued. The Pivot project has now taken off. One initial committer is lost in action and has been removed from the initial committer list, as well as the couple of patches that he supplied has been reverted. The remaining 4 committers have submitted CLAs, accounts has been created, authorization setup, Jira has been created, Confluence space has been created, and we are soon to do the initial codebase submission. All activities of setting up the podling has been tracked in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIVOT-1.
