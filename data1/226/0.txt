SystemML provides declarative large-scale machine learning (ML) that aims at.flexible specification of ML algorithms and automatic generation of hybrid.runtime plans ranging from single node, in-memory computations, to.distributed computations such as Apache Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark.SystemML has been incubating since 2015-11-02.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Grow SystemML community: increase mailing list activity,. increase adoption of SystemML for scalable machine learning, encourage. data scientists to adopt DML and PyDML algorithm scripts, respond to. user feedback to ensure SystemML meets the requirements of real-world. situations, write papers, and present SystemML at conferences. 2. Core library improvements, including Apache Spark integration. 3. Improved SystemML documentation to lower the learning curve. 4. Produce a release.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. The community is blocked, and expects that the SystemML Apache JIRA. site will be available shortly, as detailed in INFRA-10714.How has the community developed since the last report?. We have started to see few non original committers ask questions on the. dev list, and the existing committers are actively helping these. contributors.How has the project developed since the last report?. All infrastructure, except for JIRA, are in place and in use by the. community.Date of last release:. NONE.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?. NONE.Signed-off-by:.
