Apache SIS is a toolkit that spatial information system builders or users.can use to build applications containing location context. This project will.look to store reference implementations of spatial algorithms, utilities,.services, etc. as well as serve as a sandbox to explore new ideas. Further,.the goal is to have Apache SIS grow into a thriving Apache top-level.community, where a host of SIS/GIS related software (OGC datastores, REST-ful.interfaces, data standards, etc.) can grow from and thrive under the.Apache umbrella.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?. The thread here: http://s.apache.org/Q2z reports a "where is the project". going status. I think we've come up with a plan of action items to. develop on. We've elected 2 new PPMC members and committers (Adam Estrada. and Andrew Hart) and both are on board and have their accounts set up. In response to reviving the project, I'd urge folks to give us a chance. with the new blood we've infused and with our development plan that Chris. proposed.Community progress since the last report. Adam Estrada and Andrew Hart were VOTEd in as PPMC members and committers.Project progress since last report. SIS was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on February 21, 2010. Here is the current list of items to work on for 0.2-incubating. - SIS-28 Create a Layer Service for Google Earth Integration. - SIS-13 Change QuadTree Reader/Writer to use URLs instead of String. file paths. - SIS-11 Basic CLI for SIS. - SIS-10 Ability to create SIS data from WKT specs. - SIS-9 Allow for multiple spatial reference systems. - SIS-8 Build a common SIS data container for spatial data. The goal is to make some progress on these issues before the next report. and have a status update on the 0.2-incubating release.Signed off by mentor: mattmann, greddin, kevan, joes.
