SAMOA provides a collection of distributed streaming algorithms for the most common data mining and machine learning tasks such as classification, clustering, and regression, as well as programming abstractions to develop new algorithms that run on top of distributed stream processing engines (DSPEs) It features a pluggable architecture that allows it to run on several DSPEs such as Apache Storm, Apache S4, and Apache Samza.SAMOA has been incubating since 2014-12-15.Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:.Revitalize the project by resuming development.Enlarge the user base and contributing community.Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?.None.How has the community developed since the last report?.Mailing list activity:.@dev: 12 messages.How has the project developed since the last report?.Retirement has been suggested due to its very low activity.To restart engagement, Corey Sterling has been elected as commiter in late August. With his help, we are preparing a new release of Apache SAMOA in early September. Corey Sterling has experience on open source software, as an example, he did the last release of MOA, an open source software non-distributed for data streams very related to SAMOA. He works at University of Waikato.How would you assess the podling's maturity?.Please feel free to add your own commentary. Community building.Date of last release:.2016-09-30.When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?.August 2019.Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?.Yes, the mentors have been helpful and responsive.Signed-off-by:. (samoa) Alan Gates.Comments: Happy to see a new committer, hopefully this will help kickstart the project.IPMC/Shepherd notes:.Dave Fisher: Let's see if bringing on a new committer revitalizes the podling.
