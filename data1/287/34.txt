NPanday allows projects using the .NET framework to be built with Apache.Maven.NPanday has been incubating since 2010-08-13.The podling continues to have a low amount of activity. However, there are.still committers involved that wish to see it succeed. A recent prod from.the Incubator PMC has reignited some interest, including from new.contributors and existing users of the project.Unfortunately, we have gradually lost mentors, and the last one resigned in.November. Thankfully, Raphael Bircher has volunteered to step in. There are.ASF members on the project, however we could still use other independent.mentors willing to keep an eye on the project and keep prodding.In the current state, we might find it difficult to get enough votes.together for a release.We have requested that JIRA notifications be sent to the dev@ list instead.of commits@, so we can keep as much discussion in one place as possible.With the recent activity, we have started to identify a list of things that.need to be done to get activity moving again, and the next release out. This.needs to be fleshed out, including details of who is willing to contribute.to them.The last release was made on 16 May 2011.Signed-off-by:. (npanday) Raphael Bircher.Shepherd notes:. Justin Mclean (jmclean):. Last report was July 2013. At noted in the current report there are some. issues to overcome for the project to move forward. In the last month there been some increased activity on the mailing. lists (thanks to the last shepherd) but as yet no fixes or patches have. been submitted. The project currently has only one mentor (just. appointed) and the PPMC seems to have gone missing.
