iPMC Reviewers: jerenkrantz, yoavs, jukka, twlSince our last report a number of people have begun contributing bug reports and fixes through JIRA, including some huge improvements to the widget tests that are now very robust. (Thank you Trevor) Hopefully some of these contributors will be converted to committers in short order.XAP is in the midst of getting out a first release - most issues have been resolved (file headers, etc), still working through a couple things like NOTICE file contents.The Wiki has been updated with more information for both developers and users. (But probably needs updating againTechnical changes include many bug fixes to individual widgets, replacement of the logging mechanism with a log4j-based approach (feedback on how close this is to log4j would be appreciated, the code is in xap/log/Logger.js), a cleaned up launch mechanism, conversion of config file from XML to JSON format, some performance improvements, etc.Future plans: More bug fixes, better samples and examples, constant code cleanup and maintenance, performance improvements. (Initial loading, memory use) Beyond that need to discuss as release winds down.
