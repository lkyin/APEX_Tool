Chukwa is an open source data collection system for monitoring large distributed systems. Chukwa is built on top of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), HBase and Map/Reduce framework and inherits Hadoop’s scalability and robustness. Chukwa also includes a ﬂexible and powerful toolkit for displaying, monitoring and analyzing results to make the best use of the collected data. Completed migration to use HBase as data storage. Updated documents for architecture, programming guide and quick start guide. Preparing for Chukwa 0.5.0 release. Migrated from ant build system to maven build system to reduce site deployment overhead.Chukwa depends on Apache Hadoop. More specifically, it requires a.stable version of Hadoop that supports append/sync. Since joining the.incubator, we have been unable to roll a release because these.requirements were not met. Now that there is a stable version of.Hadoop that supports the features we require, we expect to roll a.release presently, attract contributors, and set the project back on.track for graduation.Signed off by mentor: omalley, cdouglas.
