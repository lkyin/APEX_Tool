(incubating since November 27th, 2009.Clerezza is a framework and set of components designed to make it easy to.build applications for the semantic and the social web.Although Clerezza could technically graduate, activity has been very low and.diminishing since 2010, especially regarding the content management components.The reusable RDF libraries are used in Stanbol for example and see slightly.more activity.We've started a discussion about the future of Clerezza, with a proposal to.move those reusable libraries to another project, probably Stanbol, and.terminate incubation of the other components.The goal is to have a decision on this within a few days.Signed-off-by: bdelacretaz (mentor), jukka.IPMC comments:. jukka: See also Stanbol's TLP report to the board.
