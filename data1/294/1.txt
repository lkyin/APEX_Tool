Quickstep is a high-performance data processing platform that aims to fully exploit the vast and increasing amount of parallelism that is packed in individual nodes. The projectâ€™s initial target is interactive in-memory data warehousing workloads, and early results indicate that Quickstep is over an order-of-magnitude faster than existing platforms including Spark 2.0 and PostgreSQL 9.6 Beta1. .Quickstep has been incubating since 2016-03-29.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1.
