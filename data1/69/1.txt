Bloodhound is an issue tracker derivative of Trac, with the goal of making.deployment easy, and usage intuitive.Bloodhound has been incubating since December 2011.The current three most important issues toward graduation are:. 1. Improving community diversity. 2. Lowering the barrier to entry and development. 3. Creating shippable releases and getting user feedback.We missed the report last month, largely due to inattention. There were.a number of discussions about the relationship between Bloodhound and Trac.in early January, but those appear to have been resolved to the satisfaction.of both sets of developers and the Incubator PMC.Since incubation some effort has gone into setting up some of our ASF.infrastructure, most notably a VM to host an instance of Trac to use for.project and issue planning. This instance will hopefully be migrated to.Bloodhound soon, as we hope to be self-hosting. We also have set up:. - Mailing lists. - Commit access for all the initial committers. - Placeholder pages for the main website and Trac/Bloodhound front pages.The community is going through a learning process about how the ASF.functions, and how to be inclusive of the external community. Although.most of the current developers are colocated, the mailing lists have.started to see increased activity, as the existing community learns to.work in a more open manner. A couple of additional people have expressed.interest in participating, and are actively posting to the mailing list. .A number of mockup designs have started to flow into the repository.The primary goals of the community include getting something potential.developers can play with into the repository, and creating a release to.get some widespread exposure to the project.Signed off by mentor: gstein, hwright.
