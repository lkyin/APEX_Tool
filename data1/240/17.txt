IPMC reviews: jukka, jim.UIMA is a component framework for the analysis of unstructured content such as text, audio and video. UIMA entered incubation on October 3, 2006.Some recent activity:.The UIMA Tooling Eclipse Plugins are now available from an Eclipse update site on our web page.Version 2.2.2, our fourth incubator release, is currently up for vote on uima-dev.Also up for vote for its first release is the Annotator Package, a selection of useful plug-ins for UIMA that were developed as part of our sandbox. Our hope is that this will help encourage others to participate in submitting their own components to the sandbox, and ultimately to become UIMA committers.UIMA-AS (Asynchronous Scaleout), an extension to UIMA that uses JMS and Apache ActiveMQ is nearing its first release. There has been a lot of development work on this recently. Temis, a commercial company using UIMA, has expressed interest in joining the development work around this new capability, and we welcome their participation.The Cas Editor is now ready for its first release inside the UIMA project, and we expect it to be out shortly after the base UIMA 2.2.2 release.Items to complete before graduation:.We still need to attract more new committers.Community:.We continue to do outreach to attract new contributors, which may become committers. We hope that the upcoming release of the Annotator Package and UIMA-AS will help.There's a good amount of traffic on both the dev and user list.There'll be an academic UIMA workshop at LREC 2008 (major data-oriented computational linguistics conference.IPMC comments:.jukka: Too comfortable in the Incubator?
