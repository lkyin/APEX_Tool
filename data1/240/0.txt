Accepted into the Incubator 10/06.UIMA is a component framework for the analysis of unstructured content such as text, audio and video.There was some discussion on incubator-general about changing the name of the project to something that's not an acronym and does not have a history outside of Apache. The final consensus though was that the arguments for keeping the name outweighed the ones for changing, so we're sticking with it.After the naming discussion was settled, we started getting the infrastructure set up:.Mailing lists set up.SVN repository created.Apache, SVN, Jira accounts for committers (mostly doneInitial code drop checked in after receipt of software grant, Apache license headers inserted.Initial version of website created.Our priorities for the next few weeks:.Finish infrastructure set up, get settled in with Apache.Work on our (maven2) build.Work on our website, document our build etc.Start directing our existing user base to Apache to attract some early adopters.Discuss ways to attract new committers.
