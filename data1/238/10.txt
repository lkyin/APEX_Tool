Tuscany provides infrastructure for developing service-oriented applications.Tuscany is still focusing on community building. We added four new committers, Venkat Krishnan, Luciano Resende, Ignacio Silva-Lepe and Rajith Attapattu. We also have others actively contributing, particularly in the areas of Declarative DAS, BPEL, JMS, SCA Policy and OSGi integration.In addition, we have had a lot of development activity:.C++ M2 was released.A DAS M2 release candidate was submitted to the IPMC for vote and is currently underway.A SDO M2 release candidate was submitted to the IMPMC for vote and is currently underway.A Java M2 release candidate is currently being worked on and will hopefully be submitted soon to the IPMC for vote.Our top two issues to resolve are:.1. Increasing community diversity. A significant number of committers work for one vendor. We are making efforts to attract individual contributors in addition to normal avenues (helping on lists with questions, etc.) including presenting at conferences (ApacheCon) and webinars.2. Preparation for graduation needs to start including a discussion of what timeframe is appropriate.
