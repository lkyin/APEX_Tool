Eclipse based tools for developing applications on the Hadoop platform.Entered 11/09/2012.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:.- Finish on boarding the podling. Including infra work (waiting on a git repository to be created see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-5512), completing the podlings.xml and then IP clearance for code and committers.- Porting and releasing existing codebase to support multiple versions of Hadoop in a single IDE instance. During this time building understanding of the Apache processes around working and releasing.- Grow the podling community in terms of users and contributors.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.- As mentioned above, we have been waiting on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-5512 for over three weeks, not having our git repository is a big barrier to progress.How has the community developed since the last report?.- The only change in the community was the withdrawal of Chris Douglas as mentor, replaced by Suresh Marru.- Committers are currently in the process of filing ICLAs.How has the project developed since the last report?.- The project hasn't moved a lot due to not yet completing the podling on boarding.Signed-off-by: rvs, smarru, mattmann, adc.
