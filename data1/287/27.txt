NPanday allows projects using the .NET framework to be built with Apache Maven.NPanday has been incubating since 2010-08-13.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. work out a concrete plan towards graduation ASAP. 2. encourage newer contributors to do so on a continuing basis. 3. reach out to other projects using .NET that might be interested in working with NPanday.Some new attention has sparked recently around getting support for Mono back up to par, which might help resolve some of the regressions that are in the way of a release. Hopefully some of the newer contributors will be able to continue helping out in that regard.Users have drawn attention to the fact that the home page doesn't list any recent activity. Some effort needs to go into making it clearer of the current status and how to contribute.The existing committers continue to be busy with other projects, but are still interested in seeing the project succeed and looking for new volunteers.We are still short on mentors, and would appreciate any volunteers.Please check this when you have filled in the report for NPanday.Signed-off-by: .Dennis Lundberg: (npanday.Shepherd notes:.
