iPMC Reviewers: jukkaThe W3C WSDL working group completed their work and the WSDL 2.0 specification is now a recommendation. This is exciting news for Woden as there is now an official W3C recommended spec to implement. The Woden team is still reporting issues and asking questions from the W3C Web services group and plans to contribute further test cases to the WSDL 2.0 test suite.Woden M7b was released on Aug 3, in support of Axis2. The Woden team is currently working towards an M8 release that will include full support for the WSDL 2.0 spec, including assertion checking. Also of note in this release will be a mechanism for extending Woden in both parsing and assertions. Woden has also received a serialization contribution from Sagara Gunathunga that is under review and we hope will be able to add a key piece to Woden.Woden has been an incubator project for roughly two years. Most items on the graduation list have been completed. We're currently working towards completing the few remaining items and then will propose to the WS and Incubator PMCs that Woden graduate to the Apache Web Services project.iPMC comments:.jukka: Missing the "Woden is ." intro.jukka: +1 to a push towards graduation.
