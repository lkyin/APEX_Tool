Numerous bug fixes and features were added surrounding the interaction Mesos has with ZooKeeper, including in-process ZooKeeper testing (contributed by John Sirois. Progress has been made on moving the build system to autotools. We'd like to accomplish this before trying to do a release.Signed off by mentor:.
