A Flexible and Efficient Library for Deep Learning.MXNet has been incubating since 2017-01-23.Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:.Address past release issues. Successfully and smoothly make releases.ONGOING.Improve development process and tooling to help reduce the overhead of releases.ONGOING.Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?.MXNet 2.0 has started (10 projects completed): https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/projects/18 RFC: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16167.There have been stability issues and high cost associated with the CI system due to complexity and high load.We are sufferring from high failure rate in CI due to technical debts such as flaky tests.Efforts on reducing waste in time and cost on CI: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/projects/19.We intend to update our toolchain and improve engineering practices to address technical debts and improve the development experiences.We want to improve automation and address licensing issues to reduce release overhead.We seek experiences from other projects with extensive C/C++ development on validating for a diverse set of platforms, and experiences on reducing the test complexity and runtime. We appreciate any lessons other projects can share in these aspects.How has the community developed since the last report?.The number of GitHub contributors increased to currently 781 (2019-03-28; +2.4% since last report.Active discussions on user forums.https://discuss.mxnet.io/ (English, 2.5K registered users (+8.7%) and 7.7K posts (+4.0%)https://discuss.gluon.ai/ (Chinese, 8.1K registered users (+6.9%) and 21.9K posts(+1.3% since last report)Active blogs and social media presence.Medium (https://medium.com/apache-mxnet) w/ 1.8k followers (+5.9%Twitter account (https://twitter.com/ApacheMXNet) w/ 2.4k followers (+5.4%Active video channels.YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/apachemxnet) w/ 1.04k subscriber (+9.6% since last reportChinese YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjeLwTKPMlDt2segkZzw2ZQ) w/ 5.71k subscribers (+5.7%(in China) bilibili space (https://space.bilibili.com/209599371) w/ 22k subscriber (+4.8% since last reportHighlights in MXNet ecosystem.Dive into Deep Learning has 50.5K 28-day active users, and has attracted 20.7K stars & 230+ contributors on GitHub.
