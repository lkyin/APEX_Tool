Bigtop is a project for the development of native packaging and stack.tests of the Hadoop ecosystem.Bigtop entered incubation on June 20, 2011.Primary issues blocking graduation:. - Need for increased diversity and additional committers.Issues which Incubator PMC and/or ASF Board might need/wish to be aware of:. A discussion of whether publishing non-ASF, but AL licensed binary. convenience artifacts as part of Bigtop release is. #1 consistent with Apache Software Foundation policies. #2 desirable by Apache Software Foundation. resulted in a very productive email exchange:. http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.incubator.general/35545/focus=35627. A consensus was reached that doing so does NOT seem to violate any. established Apache Software Foundation policies. Given a difference of opinion on #2 a compromise was reached: starting. from Bigtop 0.4.0 release, the project will vote exclusively on source. artifacts and it will NOT use ASF infrastructure for hosting the. resulting binary convenience artifacts. This decision was explicitly. approved by one of our mentors -- Alan Gates.Community development since last report:. Patrick Taylor Ramsey added as a Bigtop committer. Our regular Bay Area Bigtop meetup/class is going strong with ~15 members. http://www.meetup.com/HandsOnProgrammingEvents/. Bigtop meetup hackathon attracted more than 20 people:. http://www.meetup.com/HandsOnProgrammingEvents/events/61455472/. Started submission process for a talk at ACM Bigdata camp. Major Hadoop vendors/shops are slowly embracing Bigtop and using it as. a basis of their infrastructure:. - Cloudera: http://www.cloudera.com/cdh4/. - HortonWorks: http://drcos.boudnik.org/2012/05/hortonworks-disribution-secretly.html. - Some uptake at EBay . - Some uptake at TrendMicro.Project development since last report:. - released Bigtop 0.3.0-incubating. - 0.4.0-incubating is on schedule to be release end of June 2012. - started working on supporting Giraph. - started working on supporting Hue. - started working on supporting Hama. - used Bigtop to validate Hadoop 1.0. RC and Hadoop 2.0.0-alpha RC releases. - used Bigtop to validate HBase 0.92 RC. - used Bigtop to validate Oozie 3.2 RC. - increased the # and scope of integration tests. - major re-factoring of package tests.Signed off by mentor: phunt, tomwhite.Shepherd: Matt Franklin.
