BatchEE projects aims to provide a JBatch implementation (aka JSR352) and a.set of useful extensions for this specification.BatchEE has been incubating since 2013-10-03.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Build a Community. We really need to work on this. Mark Struberg will hold a talk . about BatchEE on JAX in early May 2014 in Mainz. 2. Ship stable releases. This looks good so far. We are pretty close on getting . a first release out. 3. Establish an ASF culture. . We also need to work on this front. The committer circly does fine. on the technical side but we really need to raise attention about . the importance of structural things like not pulling in too many. foreign dependencies and shipping board reports in time.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. None yet. We still have to work on a few things but nothing critical. I. will make sure we raise issues if we cannot solve them.How has the community developed since the last report?. The community does not yet grow much in terms of committers. There are. quite a few interested users though and the project gets used in. production projects already.How has the project developed since the last report?. We have missed reporting for 2 consecutive months due to time constraints. of the involved leaders. We will report the next 3 month to show our. commitment.Date of last release: . none yet. We are preparing to release 0.1-incubating within . the next 2 month.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?. . We still have the initial set of committers.Signed-off-by: .
