SAMOA provides a collection of distributed streaming algorithms for the most.common data mining and machine learning tasks such as classification,.clustering, and regression, as well as programming abstractions to develop new.algorithms that run on top of distributed stream processing engines (DSPEs.It features a pluggable architecture that allows it to run on several DSPEs.such as Apache Storm, Apache Flink, and Apache Samza.SAMOA has been incubating since 2014-12-15.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Elect new PPMC members. 2. Enlarge the community. 3.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. None.How has the community developed since the last report?. Mailing list activity (June 2017 - August 2017):. @dev: 120 messages. Jira issues backlog (June 2017 - August 2017):. Created: 4. Resolved: 5. We saw the engagement of new contributors, who are plausible candidates for the PPMC.How has the project developed since the last report?. Planning a new release in the next month. Work on the release was delayed due to summer holidays for most of the contributors. Integrated Apache Kafka support and support for JSON and Avro. Developed a new Boosting algorithm that will be integrated shortly. Integrated new version of the SAMOA instances. Integrated ability to store predictions on disk.How would you assess the podling's maturity?.Please feel free to add your own commentary. Initial setup. Working towards first release. Community building. Nearing graduation. Other:.Date of last release:. 2016-09-30.When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?. None.Signed-off-by:. (samoa) Alan Gates. Comments:.
