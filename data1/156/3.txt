--Description--.ManifoldCF is an incremental crawler framework and set of connectors designed to pull documents from various kinds of repositories into search engine indexes or other targets. The current bevy of connectors includes Documentum (EMC), FileNet (IBM), LiveLink (OpenText), Meridio (Autonomy), SharePoint (Microsoft), RSS feeds, and web content. ManifoldCF also provides components for individual document security within a target search engine, so that repository security access conventions can be enforced in the search results.ManifoldCF has been in incubation since January, 2010. It was originally a planned subproject of Lucene but is now a likely top-level project.--A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation--.1. We need at least one additional active committer, as well as additional users and repeat contributors.2. We may want another release before graduating.3. We'd like to see long-term contributions for project testing, especially infrastructure access.--Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?--.All issues have been addressed to our satisfaction at this time.--How has the community developed since the last report?--.A book has being completed, and is becoming available in early-release form, available from Manning Publishing. We have signed up two new committers and one new mentor. We continue to have user community interest. We've had a number of extremely helpful bug reports and contributions from the field.--How has the project developed since the last report?--.An 0.1 release was made on January 31, 2011, and a 0.2 release occurred on May 17, 2011. Another release is being considered.Signed off by mentor: Tommaso Teofili.
