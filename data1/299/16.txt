No.How has the community developed since the last report?. We are seeing a lot of traction in the community, over the improvement in. deployment and management of applications using Slider. Good number of. emails are pouring in the dev list, primarily on creation of Slider. packages for newer applications and willingness to contribute code. Few. presentations and meetups were organized by the community, socializing. their Slider-ized applications. Occasional patches were submitted and a. number of features added to the recent releases were driven by end-user. needs. We still have to get those people into long term coding, and then. bring them in to the committer group. .How has the project developed since the last report?. We released slider-0.80.0-incubating in May with 64 JIRAs resolved. It was. one of Slider's most important release, with several critical business. application features like rolling upgrade, co-processor support for. dynamic addition of libraries, and support for Docker containers. We've been debating when to switch from Hadoop 2.6+ support to 2.7.1+. only. Given how Slider has always tended to push much of the YARN. services work, it's time to pick up on the changes they've put in.Date of last release:. 2015-05-18 slider-0.80.0-incubating.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?. 2015-07-07: Yu (Thomas) Liu.Signed-off-by:.
