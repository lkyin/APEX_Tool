We've been very busy with new feature development for Roller, but we have also spent time preparing Roller for graduation and now that we've got an Apache web and wiki presence, two of the last items on our checklist, we feel that we're just about ready to call for a vote More about that later. For now, here's some status on our accomplishments since our last report in July 2006:.Roller 3.0 released. We detailed the new features of Roller 3.0 in the last report. They include a completely new rendering system with a new URL structure, new template models/macros, better multi-language blog support and a new blog-based front page. We released Roller 3.0 on November 7, 2006. http://rollerweblogger.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Roller_3.0_WhatsNew.Roller 3.1 development. Following Roller 3.0, we developed another major new release of Roller. The major new features are full-support for weblog tagging, a better rich-text editor based on Xinha, full-preview and bulk-delete of comments. We've made three release candidate releases and with RC3 we're just about ready to make the final release. http://rollerweblogger.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Roller_3.1_WhatsNew.Established Roller web presence at apache.org. We have now established a web site for Roller at apache.org. Keeping with our community traditions, this site will be a simple front-page that links into a wiki where actual content will be created and updated. http://incubator.apache.org/roller/.Established Roller wiki space at apache.org. We have also started to migrate wiki content from the old Roller wiki to the new wiki site at apache.org. We chose Confluence because we want the wiki to serve as a tightly controlled content management system (similar to the way we were using JSPWiki before http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ROLLER.We have almost completed a JPA implementation of Roller back-end. The new implementation is passing about 95% of the back-end unit tests and we are actively working on getting it ready to test and compare against our current Hibernate implementation.As part of our community building efforts we presented talk on Roller at ApacheCon US 2006 and have submitted multiple Roller-related proposals to ApacheCon EU and JavaOne 2007.
