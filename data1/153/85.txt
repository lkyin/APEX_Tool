Lucene.Net was accepted into the Apache Incubator in February 2011.Originally it was a sub project of the Lucene Project.Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in.C# and targeted at .NET runtime users. Lucene.Net has three primary goals:. - Maintain the existing line-by-line port from Java to C#, fully automating. and commoditizing the process such that the project can easily synchronize. with the Java Lucene release schedule. - High-performance C# search engine library. - Maximize usability and power when used within the .NET runtime. To that. end, it will present a highly idiomatic, carefully tailored API that. takes advantage of many of the special features of the .NET runtime.Recent Activity:. - Lucene.Net 2.9.4g passed a vote for release Jan 29th. We are preparing. to move the files to dist, creating NuGet packages and updating the website. - Significant Activity for Lucene.Net 3.0.3.Current Activities:. - Porting Java Lucene 3.0.3. - Porting Java Lucene 4.0. - Hashing out style guidelines (FxCop / ReSharper.Long term goals:. - Have a nearly fully automated process to convert Java Lucene to C#.
