On 22 August we created the build artifacts for version 0.12.0-incubating,. in accordance with our monthly release schedule. During the VOTE process. a question was raised on the subject of the inclusion of Apache Santuario. XMLSec in wookie. See: http://incubator.markmail.org/search/?q=wookie-dev#query:wookie-dev%20list%3Aorg.apache.incubator.wookie-dev%20date%3A201208%20+page:1+mid:hgxuhglq5pmwbs4f+state:results. It was decided to ask/consult apache legal. At present there has been no. answer on this matter and therefore the wookie release cycle is stalled. We urgently require guidance on this matter, so we can resolve this build. and consequently resume our release cycle. See: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-148.
