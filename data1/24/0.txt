MXNet is an open-source deep learning framework that allows you to define,.train, and deploy deep neural networks on a wide array of devices, from.cloud infrastructure to mobile devices. It is highly scalable, allowing.for fast model training, and supports a flexible programming model and.multiple languages.MXNet has been incubating since 2017-01-23.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Getting ICLAs signed/private@ populated. 2. Sharing documentation/mentor thoughts on being an Apache committer. 3. Migrating the code/issues over to Apache.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. None.How has the community developed since the last report?. 1. This is our first report. 2. The mailing lists are created; with the dev@ list being well populated. 3. ICLAs are being signed.How has the project developed since the last report?. 1. Trademark review seems complete. 2. A vendor, AWS, worked with Sally on a blog posting[1].Date of last release:. No Apache release yet; still being setup.When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?. At Proposal time. We have a few folk who asked to join the incubation. proposal after the vote started and will be discussed once private@. is populated.[1] - https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/excited-about-mxnet-joining-apache/.Signed-off-by:.

I find it a bit odd that the linked article uses "MXNet" repeatedly but. only refers to it as "Apache MXNet" once near the end of the page.
