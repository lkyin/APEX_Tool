(incubating since November 27th, 2009.Clerezza is a framework and set of components designed to make it easy to.build application for the semantic and the social web.A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards.graduation:. 1. Manage to get first release out and establish a process to do this. faster in the future. 2. Better documentation and tutorials on how to build apps with Clerezza. 3. We need to discuss a plan for community development with our mentors. for the next board report. The next report will contain some clear. actions.Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of:. Creating a release turned out to be more difficult than expected, mostly. due to legal/licensing issues. We hope that once this is resolved for. the first release it will be easier for subsequent releases. While. progress has been slow, we think the next release candidate will be. proposed very soon. Nothing is blocking progress but the legal problems. have been discovered late and were time consuming to repair - also. because we have no experience with this so far.How has the community developed since the last report:. - A new interesting person has shown up on the mailing lists. - Patch contributed by non-committer. - Domeo Annotation Toolkit is using Clerezza. (http://annotationframework.org/.How has the project developed since the last report. - Changes to project structure and naming as a result of trying to. create a release. - Work to meet legal requirements / consolidate NOTICE/LICENSE files. - Bug-fixes.Signed off by mentor: bdelacretaz, rgardler.
