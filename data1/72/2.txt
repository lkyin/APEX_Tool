We are planning our first hackathon. There have been community discussions about the goals for a future. 1.0 release, in particular whether the project should be reorganized. to allow projects to use the optimizer core without using SQL parser. and code-generation facilities.How has the project developed since the last report?.

The release has. taken a lot longer than it should have because it frequently makes. this newbie feel like an idiot.
