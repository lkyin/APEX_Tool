A cloud agnostic library that enables developers to access a variety of supported cloud providers using one API.jclouds has been incubating since 2013-04-29.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. We are working on our first release - iterating over issues currently, making sure we have a proper ASF release ready to go. 2. Since this is the first ASF project for some of the committers, it's taking some time for everyone to adjust to the Apache way, but we're getting there. 3. We need to figure out details on our wiki and site implementaiton.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.Not particularly - we're definitely edging against some of the boundaries of what's allowed in an Apache project re: license headers, specifically in test expectation files, but we're getting there.How has the community developed since the last report?.The community is roughly the same - no changes in committer list. We have continued to receive patch submissions and JIRAs from new people, which is, of course, great.How has the project developed since the last report?.A lot. =) More specifically:. We've moved our source to the Apache git repos. We've moved to ASF JIRA and mailing lists. We've renamed our Maven groupIds to org.apache.jclouds, and are publishing SNAPSHOTs to repository.apache.org. The jclouds.{org,com,net} domain names have been transferred to Apache, and the jclouds trademark is en route. We've been working on RCs for Apache jclouds 1.6.1-incubating, ironing out the many little gotchas, license issues, etc that are to be expected when folding such a large, complex existing project into the ASF. We hope to have a viable final RC presented to the IPMC for voting within a week or so, assuming our mentors sign off on the next RC.Date of last release: .No ASF release yet.Please check this when you have filled in the report for jclouds.Signed-off-by: .Brian McCallister: (jcloudsTom White: (jcloudsHenning Schmiedehausen: (jcloudsDavid Nalley: (jcloudsJean-Baptiste Onofr√©: (jcloudsMohammad Nour El-Din: (jcloudsOlivier Lamy: (jcloudsTomaz Muraus: (jcloudsSuresh Marru: (jcloudsCarlos Sanchez: (jclouds.Shepherd notes:.Really? 10 mentors and no report?
