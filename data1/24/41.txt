A Flexible and Efficient Library for Deep Learning.MXNet has been incubating since 2017-01-23.Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:.Address licensing and trademark issues for the binary releases in the community.ONGOING. See update in the next section.Address release issues. Successfully and smoothly make releases without WIP disclaimer.ONGOING.Improve development process and tooling to help reduce the overhead of releases.ONGOING.Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?.Binary Distribution Licensing Issue.MXNet 2.0 first public beta, interoperable with NumPy, is on the way: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/projects/18 RFC: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16167.Issues with releases and distributions.Background.In May 2020 The MXNet PPMC has proactively initiated a ASF policy compliance review 1 and a license review 2 with the Apache Legal team.The license review uncovered that.Building unmodified MXNet release source code with the optional NVidia GPU support enabled results in a binary subject to restrictions of NVidia EULA.PPMC members and committers uploaded convenience releases to repository.apache.org which contain Category-X components. Both GPL and NVidia EULA components were found.The policy review uncovered that:.Prior ASF guidance to the PPMC (December 2018 legal review 3) was incomplete and did not include a reference to the "unwritten" rule that convenience binary distributions created by third-parties using ASF Trademarks must not include Category-X components. Based on this discovery, the Draft Downstream Distribution Branding Policy was updated in June 2020 to include the "unwritten" requirement. Based on the updated guidance, PPMC discovered various third-party trademark infringements.The policy review did not yet conclude on the questions if.The PPMC may create nightly development builds (audience restricted to dev list subscribers as per Release policy 4) for the purpose of testing and developing MXNet;.List of issues and their status.Justin classified the issues into 14 items.Source and convenance binary releases containing Category X licensed code.See summary from license review in Background section. Source code releases do not contain Category X code; Takedown of binary releases on repository.apache.org is pending on Apache Infra. (Trademark infringements of 3rd-parties such as on pypi are discussed separately.Website giving access to downloads of non released/unapproved code.Website contained links to nightly development builds which have been removed [5]; Going forward the PPMC intends to begin periodical voting on Alpha and Beta Releases which will then be linked from the website.Website giving access to releases containing Category X licensed code.Website contained links to third-party distributions incorporating Category-X components (see summary from license review above Disclaimers were added to the website clarifying the third-party status of the releases and their licenses. [5].Web site doesn't given enough warning to users of the issues with non (P)PMC releases or making it clear that these are not ASF releases.Website contained links to third-party distributions incorporating Category-X components (see summary from license review above Disclaimers were added to the website clarifying the third-party status of the releases and their licenses. [5].Maven releases containing Category X licensed code.See summary from license review in Background section. Source code releases do not contain Category X code; Takedown of binary releases on repository.apache.org is pending on Apache Infra. [6] (Trademark infringements of 3rd-parties are discussed separately.PyPI releases containing Category X licensed code.There are no PiPy releases by the PPMC. Please refer to the trademark infringement section of the report.Docker releases containing Category X licensed code.There are no Docker releases by the PPMC. Please refer to the trademark infringement section of the report.Docker releases containing unreleased/unapproved code.There are no Docker releases by the PPMC. The existence of third-party releases containing unreleased code was approved in 3 and is also in line with the current Downstream Distribution Branding Draft Policy. ("using any particular revision from the development branch is OK" 3.Trademark and branding issues with PiPy and Docker releases.There are no PiPy releases by the PPMC. Please refer to the trademark infringement section of the report.Trademark and brand issues with naming of releases.There are no binary releases by the PPMC besides the repository.apache.org releases discussed above, which are being removed. Please refer to the trademark infringement section of the report.Developer releases available to users and public searchable https://repo.mxnet.io / https://dist.mxnet.io.Links to the nightly development builds were removed from the MXNet website and a robot.txt file was added to prevent indexing of the sites. These websites are removed from Google search index.Releases and other nightly builds on https://repo.mxnet.io / https://dist.mxnet.io containing category X licensed code.Neither of the two site contains Releases. It is an open question of the policy review (see Background section above) if nightly development builds may or may not contain Category X components.Lack of clarity on all platforms for what is an ASF release and what is not.https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/releases?after=1.2.0 previously did not distinguish MXNet releases prior to MXNet joining the Incubator. Disclaimers were added. Other PPMC platforms do not contain references to non-ASF releases (MXNet releases made prior to MXNet joining the ASF The PPMC is aware of old third-party releases created prior to MXNet joining the ASF which are still available, but can be clearly separated from the ASF MXNet releases due to the lack of reference to the Apache foundation. PPMC was able to find an exemplar such release at [7]. If there are concerns from the Incubator, PPMC can request the third-parties to take down these releases, as editing their Description to include references to events (MXNet joining Apache) is not supported due to immutability constraints.

In particular, Bob has provided guidance on the license and trademark issue.Is the PPMC managing the podling's brand / trademarks?.PPMC notes that there are multiple trademark infringements based on both the redistribution of MXNet with addition of unreleased code and the redistribution of MXNet with Category-X GPL and Category-X NVidia components. PPMC intends to handle both issues separately.Unauthorized redistribution of unreleased code by third-parties.PPMC members have reached out to the offending third parties (Nvidia Corporation and Amazon Web Services) via inofficial channels and notified them of the problem. If the problem is not resolved by the end of July 2020, PPMC will request guidance from the Brand Management Team on how to formally notify the offenders of their trademark infringement.Unauthorized redistribution of Category-X GPL and NVidia CUDA EULA.components by third-parties.PPMC members note that the issue of "NVidia CUDA EULA infecting any application built with CUDA support" is an industry-wide problem. PPMC is not aware of any individual or corporation correctly labeling their binary distributions subject to the NVidia CUDA EULA. Instead, PPMC found that for example Facebook claims distribution of PyTorch under BSD License (BSD-3) and Google claims distribution of Tensorflow under Apache 2.0 License, despite both being subject to the CUDA EULA. Thus, PPMC has contacted NVidia Corporation and requested NVidia Corporation to add clarifying language that applications based on the CUDA SDK with material additional functionality may be licensed under a license of the application owner's choice, consistent with existing industry "practice". The issue was also discussed with NVidia and other Deep Learning Framework implementers during the Nvidia Deep Learning Framework Developer Council meeting, during which NVidia promised to conclude their internal review and follow-up with the PPMC.PPMC thus recommends to give NVidia the chance to clarify and improve their license. As NVidia employs a team for working on MXNet, the PPMC is optimistic about receiving a detailed clarification and resolution from NVidia.If NVidia fails to clarify their license or the resolution is unsatisfactory within Q3 2020, the PPMC will notify any third-parties about their license infringement and ask them to take down or rename their redistributions containing Category-X pieces.Due the substantial overhead of trademark-infringement takedown notices for any involved party, PPMC is further awaiting NVidia's clarification prior to contacting third-parties about trademark infringement due to inclusion of GPL components. This is to avoid sending two separate takedown notices in case of an unsatisfactory response by NVidia.The following downstream software distributors are known to the PPMC to be using the name MXNet while redistributing Category-X components.pypi.org.hub.docker.com.ngc.nvidia.com.aws.amazon.com.Signed-off-by:. (mxnet) Henri Yandell.Comments: Kudos to the project on the licensing review; respect to Bob and Justin for their work as well. (mxnet) Michael Wall.Comments: Good progress on the issues. They are complex but important. (mxnet) Bob Paulin.Comments: Team is making thoughtful process on the issues. Lots of good support and experiance coming from VPs of Brand and Incubator PMC.IPMC/Shepherd notes:.Justin Mclean: Good to see progress on these issues. But I have two concerns a) you may not have an active PPMC b) branding all release as "3rd party" may not be the best way to solve the issue. Hopefully the license discussion will be fruitful.
