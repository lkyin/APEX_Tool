Etch is a cross-platform, language- and transport-independent framework for.building and consuming network services. The Etch toolset includes a network.service description language, a compiler, and binding libraries for a variety.of programming languages.Status:. Development. The implementation of the binding-cpp has now reached beta status. We are. currently in the stabilizing and tests phase and are planning to do the. release within the next month. Graduation status. The graduation proposal and the composition of the PMC are currently in. discussion. We are planning to vote for the graduation proposal and the PMC. Chair in calendar week 50 and then start the discussion on general@incubator. mailing list afterwards.Community:. In order to present Etch to a wider audience we have filed another proposal. for the ApacheCon NA 2013. Furthermore we are planning to put some more. effort into the growing of the community next year e.g. by using screencasts. and writing a tutorial.Future Tasks:. - Finish graduation process. - Release of Etch 1.3.0. - Community development.Mentor note (Dashorst):. The processes in this podling are really like trying to pour molasses through. a funnel in the winter. That said, I do think that the project is viable and. an Apache community albeit a small, slow moving one. Given the nature of the. project and its usage in automobile technology I don't think it will ever be. as fast moving as a web or big data project. And that is not a bad thing for. this type of software IMO.Shepherd note (Wave):. Molasses is apt. I think that they do need to actually vote on graduate. I hope that they actually do. I think it should be a greater priority than a release.Signed-off-by: dashorst, cutting, wave.
