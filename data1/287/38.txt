NPanday allows projects using the .NET framework to be built with Apache.Maven.NPanday has been incubating since 2010-08-13.In previous reports, we indicated that there was a regression that blocked.releasing the next version. This has now been resolved, and the only thing.that stands in the way is sufficient cycles to push it out. There have been.a small number of users (not yet committers) who've stepped forward to help.test when that happens, which might help build some much needed momentum.However, as before, it's still a concern whether sufficient release votes.could be found as many of the existing PPMC are inactive. The last release.was made on 16 May 2011.The steps that have been identified are:.- apply patches that have been contributed recently.- convert the website to svnpubsub so updated documentation can be published.- perform the release steps.The NPanday automated builds have been impacted by changes to the Windows.build infrastructure again, but this is probably something that needs to be.worked around on our end.Signed-off-by: .
