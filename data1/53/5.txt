Airavata is a software toolkit which provides features to compose, manage, execute, and monitor large scale applications and workflows on computational resources ranging from local clusters to national grids and computing clouds. Airavata is incubating since May 2011.A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation. 1. The barrier of entry in contributing to Airavata seems to be high. The code, documentation and JIRA issues have to be efficiently organized and managed to appeal to wider developer community. 2. Test coverage of the code has to be increased significantly. 3. Develop a strong community with organizational diversity and well aligned with existing ASF projects as outlined here: http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/AiravataProposal#Alignment.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.No, not at this time.How has the community developed since the last report?.Patanachai Tangchaisin, Heshan Suriyarachchi and Saminda Wijeratne were VOTEd in as committers and PPMC members on the project.Chris, Ross, Ate, Suresh, Marlon, Raminder met at ApacheCon NA and had a great time! Suresh's Fast Feather talk introducing Airavata went great.How has the project developed since the last report?. Community is efficient being engaged through maling list and JIRA. The code is significantly improved with proper modular organization and packaging since entering incubation. Documentation and website have also been improved. All data base required components are integrated with Derby. The XRegistry component is deprecated in favor of synergizing with other Apache repository projects like Jack Rabbit through the JCR API. Jenkins continuos integration and sonar code analysis dashboard are setup and actively used by the community. The project is preparing its initial 0.1-incubating release, currently VOTE'ing on the 2nd release candidate.Signed off by mentor: mattmann, rgardler.
