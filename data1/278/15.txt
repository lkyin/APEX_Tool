Good activity in the previous quarter Werner Dittman was voted in as a committer and has been refactoring the initial code into a more long term format. A test build has also been created on a Win32 platform.The team involved in this are all committers on the xml-security project. Over the next quarter we will be looking to promote this from the Incubator into the xml project as a part of xml-security.
