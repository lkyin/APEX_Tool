No new PPMC members or committers added since last report, We are still. working on our first release. We believe that, as soon as we make the first. release available, many users will start using the system and will become. new contributors.How has the project developed since the last report?. We have sent a request to trademarks@apache.org to review and verify our. searches that establish that "Apache MRQL" is a suitable name. More. specifically, our US and EU trademark searches, and a Google search, show. that the project name MRQL does not conflict with a previously registered. trademark. We are now in the process of completing the MRQL codebase to. make it ready for the first release. There are two component missing that. delay this release: switching to maven as our project management tool and. verifying copyright information.Date of last release:. none yet.Signed-off-by:.
