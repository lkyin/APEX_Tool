A Flexible and Efficient Library for Deep Learning.MXNet has been incubating since 2017-01-23.Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:.Address licensing and trademark issues for the binary releases in the community.ONGOING. See update in the next section.Address release issues. Successfully and smoothly make releases without WIP disclaimer.ONGOING.Improve development process and tooling to help reduce the overhead of releases.ONGOING.Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?.The community continues to work towards resolving license and branding issues. See summary below.MXNet 2.0 first public beta, interoperable with NumPy, is on the way: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/projects/18 RFC: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16167.We are adopting Github Discussions https://github.com/apache/mxnet/discussions in favor of Discourse forum for closer connection between users and developers. https://discuss.mxnet.apache.org/ (previously discuss.mxnet.io) will serve as an archive for past user discussions.Status on license and branding issues.The PPMC continues to make progress in resolving license and branding issues. During the a recent release vote on 1.7.0, with the help from Justin, a few more source distribution and branding issues were found. Here is the status on the issues, tracked in INCUBATOR-253. As of now, the PPMC resolved 15 issues, with 9 still left.Most of the outstanding issues hinge on one key outstanding question, which is whether the components in MXNet that are produced by CUDA NVCC constitutes Category X code. PPMC member employed by Nvidia helped connect Nvidia's representatives including Michael O'Connor, Director of Deep Learning, who have been supportive in the efforts of clarification. Progress is tracked in LEGAL-516. At the moment, NVIDIA's legal is actively exploring options on resolving this issue. Michael requested extension with MXNet PPMC to not treat the related component as Category-X and delay actions until Oct. board meeting.Also, we discoveredd that there was confusion around MXNet's status around integration with Intel products. In MXNet, there has never been public distribution of MXNet where MKL was included. There was an initial inquiry around whether MKL builds can be enabled but was rejected, so this never came into practice. Also, to my knowledge Intel has not produced custom MXNet builds with closed-source components.MXNet 1.7.0 release has completed.So far, PPMC members from Intel (Tao), Nvidia (Dick), and Amazon (Leonard, Henri, Qing, Sheng) have acted to help resolve the issues.Status on open issues since last update:.Source and convenance binary releases containing Category X licensed code. (pendingSource code releases by the PPMC do not contain Category X code, no issue. Takedown of binary releases by the PPMC on repository.apache.org is on hold, see item 5. PyPI releases are made by third-party. See item 8. 5. Maven releases containing Category X licensed code. (pending.Takedown of binary releases on repository.apache.org initiated [1]. The scope depends on the resolution of LEGAL-516 [2]. 6. PyPI releases containing Category X licensed code. (pending.There are no official PyPI releases. Whether the third-party releases are compliant with branding guidelines depend on the resolution of LEGAL-516. 7. Docker releases containing Category X licensed code. (pending.There are no official Docker releases. Whether the third-party releases are compliant with branding guidelines depend on the resolution of LEGAL-516. 9. Trademark and branding issues with PyPI and Docker releases. (pending.There are no official PyPI or Docker releases. In addition, as they all contain binary from unmodified MXNet code, whether they are compliant in branding now solely depends on whether they contain Category X licensed code. Refer to item 6, 7. 10. Trademark and brand issues with naming of releases. (pending.There are no binary releases by the PPMC besides the repository.apache.org releases in item 5. 12. Releases and other nightly builds on https://repo.mxnet.io / https://dist.mxnet.io containing Category X licensed code (resolved.Neither of the two site contains releases. The binaries are only intended for testing pipelines and are made available only to MXNet developers. As part of the effort to resolve branding concern, public references to these sites are deleted [4]. 14. to 23. Branding and release of 3rd parties containing unreleased code. (pending.Known pages with issues:.https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/mxnet-release-notes/rel_20-0 3.html (item 14, pending) PPMC reached out to Nvidia. Pending action from Nvidia on branding compliance and replying on whether unreleased code was included. https://sourceforge.net/projects/apache-mxnet.mirror/ (item 15, resolved.PPMC reached out to SourceForge. SourceForge added (incubating) in name. As 1.7.0 release has completed, we removed release candidate tag from GitHub and the the mirror automatically deleted the it [3]. As such, the original issue is resolved. The PPMC will follow up with SourceForge on the functionality of filtering out non-release tags.

Will update in the next few days. In addition, MXNet PPMC identified several more listings that require correction according to the branding guideline on AWS marketplace that are related to AWS Deep Learning Container/DLAMI [6], and are actively working on addressing them.Reference links [1]: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-20442 [2]: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-516 [3]: https://sourceforge.net/projects/apache-mxnet.mirror/ [4]: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-515?focusedCommentId=17174133&pa ge=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment- 17174133 [5]: https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r1fabd3c081286b06b6e9c9283cb5986450f07d 52309db3b74bfe3a24%40%3Cprivate.mxnet.apache.org%3E [6]: https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r3f95f5766e8f1ee8fbd8183720804afdc1678f 0149f56144da.How has the community developed since the last report?.The number of GitHub contributors increased to currently 836 (2019-10-08; +7.0% since last report.Active discussions on user forums.https://discuss.gluon.ai/ (Chinese, 8.5K registered users (+2.2%) and 22.4K posts(+1.0% since last report)Active blogs and social media presence.Medium (https://medium.com/apache-mxnet) w/ 1.94k followers (+7.8%Twitter account (https://twitter.com/ApacheMXNet) w/ 2.7k followers (+2.7%Active video channels.YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/apachemxnet) w/ 1.27k subscriber (+7.6% since last reportChinese YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjeLwTKPMlDt2segkZzw2ZQ) w/ 6.28k subscribers (+1.4%(in China) bilibili space (https://space.bilibili.com/209599371) w/ 25k subscriber (+4.1% since last reportHighlights in MXNet ecosystem.Dive into Deep Learning has 74K 28-day active users, and has attracted 26.5K stars & 322 contributors on GitHub.
