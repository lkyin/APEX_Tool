Empire-db is a relational data persistence component that aims to overcome the difficulties, pitfalls and restrictions inherent in traditional Object Relational Management (ORM) approaches Empire-db is on the Apache Incubator since July 2008.Recent activities:.Following a rather quiet period in April and May development activities have significantly improved in June and July. The main goal of the development team was to finally complete the release of the Empire-db-2.0.5 release including Maven project management. The new release is now in the staging area and we are currently waiting for our mentors to approve the release, before we move on to get approval of the IPMC.Community aspects:.Recently code submissions from outside the current development team were received by users from different countries and backgrounds. The submissions are currently under review and are under consideration for an upcoming release. This gives us reasons to believe that the community is growing and demand for Empire-db is rising.Signed off by: dashorst.
