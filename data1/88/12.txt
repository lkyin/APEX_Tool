Project name - Apache CXFDescription - SOA enabling framework, web services toolkit.Date of entry - August 2006.Items to resolve before graduation:.Diversity - Active committers are mostly IONA people. We did vote in two new independent committers and Dan Diephouse now works for an IONA competitor, so some progress is being made.Community aspects:.Voted in Benson Margulies due to excellent work in several areas of the code, but specifically in the Aegis and XFire migration things.Voted in Glen Mazza due to excellent work cleaning up various parts of the code, reviewing everyones commits, updating docs, etc.Released 2.0.1-incubator and 2.0.2-incubator.Started a discussion to talk about Graduation (link) but the discussion turned more to how to increase diversity when Jim J. expressed concerns about that.The cxf-user mail list traffic has tripled since June, and the Chinese language list (http://groups.google.com/group/cxf-zh) is now at over 60 people. Many new users are participating. However, cxf-dev traffic has remained constant except for a HUGE spike (2.4x normal) in September.Code aspects:.Released 2.0.1-incubator and 2.0.2-incubator - These were bug fixes from 2.0, but some minor new features were added.Started discussing a roadmap for a 2.0.3-incubator release (bug fixes) as well as a 2.1 release.
