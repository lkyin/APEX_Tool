Invite contributors who volunteered at October workshop.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?.

Many of the remaining initial committers have not been active in the. recent years. We're following up these (and others) through private. conversations. There's been some confusion with regards to the term. "committer" - some were scared and thought it meant they had to make. a committment to work on the source code!.
