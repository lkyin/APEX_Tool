NPanday allows projects using the .NET framework to be built with Apache.Maven.NPanday has been incubating since 2010-08-13.Shepherd/Mentor notes:. P. Taylor Goetz (ptgoetz):. NPanday has missed the last two reports (last report August 2014 One. of two mentors are engaged and encouraging the podling to make a final. release before retiring (last release was on 2011-05-17 However, there. is little PPMC/Committer involvement with only 2 PPMC members showing. involvement on the dev@ list in the past year. Also confirmed that a. report reminder email was received by the dev@ list for each of the last. missed reporting periods as well at the current period. It's clear that mentors past and present have attempted to help the. NPanday project grow to a viable size -- at least enough to approve a. release, new Committer/PPMC Member, or even decide to retire -- without. success. The main warning signs appear to be:. Inability to reach community consensus (barely 2 acive Committer/PPMC. Members, making 3 +1s for any vote very difficult Inability to perform releases. Inability to grow the community to a viable size. The issues listed above do not indicate a lack of mentor involvement,. but rather a community in decline.
