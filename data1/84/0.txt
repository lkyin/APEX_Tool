IPMC reviews: jukka, jim.CouchDB is a distributed document-oriented database system written in Erlang. The project entered incubation on February 12th, 2008.The infrastructure (SVN, JIRA, mailing lists, and web-site) has been set up, and the team has moved source, documentation, and bug reports from their former homes to the ASF.Work has continued on removing code forked from other projects from the CouchDB codebase. This includes Mozilla SpiderMonkey, the code for which was previously included with CouchDB in slightly modified form. Instead, it is now treated as an external compile-time dependency via a custom C wrapper using the SpiderMonkey API. Also, work is currently in progress on replacing the dependency on a forked version of inets, which is part of the Erlang standard library (EPL), with the MIT-licensed MochiWeb library. For the time being, the MochiWeb code is included in the CouchDB codebase, mostly because there has been no official release of that library yet.
