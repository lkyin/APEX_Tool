Traffic on these lists has started to grow.We are now using JIRA alongside our old issue tracker while we migrate across.== Project development ==.Project infrastructure is now set up and tested.The last planned, non-Apache release, was done for Jena and all the related sub-projects. This will minimise disturbance to users during code migration.Code migration to Apache SVN will begin when a software grant for the majority of the codebase is received (from HP We understand that HP is actively working on this.Signed off by mentor: rgardler, snoopdave.
