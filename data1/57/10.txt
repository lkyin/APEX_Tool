Amber has been incubating since July 2010. Amber is a project to develop a Java library which provides an API specification for, and an unconditionally compliant implementation of the OAuth v1.0, v1.0a and v2.0 specifications. OAuth is a mechanism that allows users to authenticate and authorise access by another party to resources they control while avoiding the need to share their username and password credentials.The most important issues that must be addressed before graduation are:. - Clarify status of code grant. - Attract users and developers. - Generate a release.The Incubator PMC / ASF Board should be aware that:. - Community activity is relatively low. - We need copyright signoff from University of Newcastle.How has the community developed since the last report. - New users / devs show up on the mailing lists both contributing patches and asking for guidance/release.How has the project developed since the last report. - The old trunk has been moved to a branch amber-0.10 which reflects OAuth 0.10 spec. - The new trunk is being updated to latest 0.22 spec version. - Versions of artifacts have been aligned to the supported OAuth specification supported. - Discussion about preparing for an initial release is ongoing.Signed off by mentor: seelmann.
