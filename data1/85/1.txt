Crunch is a Java library for writing, testing, and running pipelines of.MapReduce jobs on Apache Hadoop.Crunch entered incubation on May 27, 2012.The most important steps towards graduation:. - Infrastructure setup (JIRA, Confluence, etc. - CCLA licensing of the existing Crunch code. - Adding new contributors. - Creating a release.Nothing that currently requires IPMC attention.Community:. The developer mailing list has been very active with bug fixes, new. features, and discussions of infrastructure setup and project policies,. both from the existing committers and other developers with an interest in. the project. The first patch from a non-committer is currently being. prepared for submission: the code is written, but we were blocking on. getting JIRA setup so that the copyright on the code could cleanly be. assigned to the ASF. The JIRA issues were resolved earlier this week. All ICLAs are in place. Cloudera has gathered all of the copyright. assignments for the existing Crunch code from non-Cloudera developers. and is preparing the CCLA to assign the copyrights on the existing Crunch. code to the ASF.Development:. The 15 commits on the project this month were primarily for documentation. and bug fixes, although we are evaluating two larger patches that bring. additional functionality to the library: 1) adding map-side joins and. 2) supporting interactive pipeline creation and execution via the Scala REPL.Signed off by mentor: phunt, tomwhite.
