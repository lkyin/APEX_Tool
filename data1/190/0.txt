Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets that consists of a high-level language for expressing data analysis programs, coupled with infrastructure for evaluating these programs The salient property of Pig programs is that their structure is amenable to substantial parallelization, which in turns enables them to handle very large data sets.Pig's infrastructure is in good shape. Several new features have been added since Pig joined the incubator. This includes streaming, parameter substitution, custom splits, better configuration management, improved memory management, etc. 147 issues resolved since. Work in progress includes addition of types and rework of the execution pipeline.The community is growing with the addition of Pi Song as a new committer.There is increased activity on the pig-dev mailing list with a number of contributors.The project needs to improve its compliance with some standard Incubator tasks, like updating the status file on a regular basis.Incubating since: October 2007.
