iPMC Reviewers: rdonkinGraffito is a framework for content-based applications, especially in portlet environments. Graffito entered incubation on September 20, 2004.Despite recent efforts the level of activity within the Graffito project remains low. The only part of the project that enjoys continued interest and commit activity is the JCR Mapping component, whose transfer into a subproject of Apache Jackrabbit is being prepared.There is little indication that the level of activity within other parts of the Graffito project would increase in future, so we will most likely request termination of the project as dormant as soon as the JCR Mapping component has been moved to Apache Jackrabbit.
