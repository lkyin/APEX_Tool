Apache Chemistry is an effort to provide a Java (and possibly others, like JavaScript) implementation of the upcoming CMIS specification Chemistry entered incubation on April 30th, 2009.The incubation process has started well. All the project infrastructure is in place and all initial committers have their Apache accounts. We even increased the headcount of the initial team as David Caruana joined the project as a new committer.Development of the Chemistry codebase has moved to Apache svn and there's been a number or related discussions on the mailing list. Overall the project is still in a startup phase as people are getting oriented with the scope and structure of the project. A number of license headers were updated to match Apache policies.Issues before graduation:.Stabilize the general interest into a sustainable development community.Make sure that all licensing details conform with Apache policies.Create an Apache release of the Chemistry codebase.
