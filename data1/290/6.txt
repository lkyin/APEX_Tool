The OpenAz report is pretty sparse and has not been signed off. by any of the podling's mentors. dev@ mailing list activity is. extremely low (15 messages in the past 3 months I would recommend. the top priority be for the project to expand the community. Colm O hEigeartaigh (coheigea):. Agreed that activity is very sparse. It seems that most of the initial committers in the proposal have not joined the project. I think we will try to get the website up and running, triage some items to be done for an initial release, and then get the release done in the next quarter. Hopefully that will drum up more interest in the project.
