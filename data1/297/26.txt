S4 (Simple Scalable Streaming System) is a general-purpose, distributed,.scalable, partially fault-tolerant, pluggable platform that allows.programmers to easily develop applications for processing continuous,.unbounded streams of data.S4 has been incubating since 2011-09-26.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. No development since last release. 2. Limited activity on mailing lists. 3. Need new committers/contributors.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. There was a discussion related to retirement but there was some interest. from the community to continue the project. However there were no. contributions since last release.How has the community developed since the last report?. No activity on dev mailing list over last couple of months.How has the project developed since the last report?. No major commits since last release. One of the reason.Date of last release:. June 2013: S4 0.6.0 released.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?. Was reported by March 2013 (Daniel GÃ³mez Ferro.Signed-off-by:. (s4) Patrick Hunt. (s4) Arun Murthy.Shepherd notes:. John Ament (johndament):. The board report reflects my sentiments as well. S4 seems to be in a. bit of rut. I tried kicking off some conversations on the dev mailing. list, no luck. It seems like there are at best five active. participants, between the users list and dev list. Considering that. there hasn't been a commit since last board report, it doesn't come off. as a good sign for me. I think retirement may be an option to start. exploring.
