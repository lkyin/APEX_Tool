NPanday has been incubating since August 2010.We've staged the NPanday-1.3-incubating release for vote which includes 2 major issues:. removal of the UAC. support for VS 2010 and .Net 4.0 Framework.This release is still waiting for other committers and mentors to test and get the required binding votes.Updated documentation was successfully deployed in http://incubator.apache.org/npanday/docs/1.3-incubating/index.html.Code licenses and license headers have all been reviewed and pass RAT.IP clearance was completed.We continue to see new people who have filed issues and submitted patches as well, however none have yet done it regularly enough to be considered as new committers.The top priorities towards graduation are:. complete 1.3-incubating release. guide regular patch contributors towards becoming committers. improve engagement of existing committers.There are no issues for the Incubator PMC or board at this time.Signed off by mentor: Dennis Lundberg.
