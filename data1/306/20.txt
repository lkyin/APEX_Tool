Incubating since: Dec-2010.Description: Wave is a real-time communication and collaboration tool.Wave in a Box (WIAB) is a server that hosts and federates waves, supports.extensive APIs, and provides a rich web client. This project also includes.an implementation of the Wave Federation protocol, to enable federated.collaboration systems (such as multiple interoperable Wave In a Box instances.Most important issues are:. - Building up community. - Extending the features set to match the features of Google Wave.Community:. One new committee added. Discussions (somewhat stalled) on additional. committers. The next major milestone regarding graduation is to make a. release. The current codebase is not considered mature enough for a. useful release, however, the community is discussing what is required to. make one, both to better understand the licensing status of our. codebase, and as a means to draw in additional developers and thus speed. up development.Signed-off-by: upayavira, mfranklin.IPMC comments:. Matt Franklin (mfranklin):. Is there anything that could be released, even in alpha/beta form? Code. completeness or maturity is not a barrier to graduation so long as the. community can demonstrate an understanding of the Apache release process. IMO, it is best to get early, alpha releases out on a regular basis. You don't have to advertise them as completely ready for prime time.
