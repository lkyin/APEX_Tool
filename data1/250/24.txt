Wookie is a Java server application that allows you to upload and deploy widgets for your applications. Wookie is based on the W3C Widgets specification, but widgets can also be included that use extended APIs such as Google Wave Gadgets and OpenSocial.Wookie has been incubating since 17th July 2009.Since May 2011:. Release 0.9 put out for vote. Published a new CMS website with more documentation. Explored with Apache Rave(incubating) community and Wookie community members idea of separate common "widget store" for handling metadata and discovery of widgets. Rough consensus was to develop separately for now, identify potential for merging later. Community members associated with two EU-funded projects (ROLE and ITEC) have been developing Wookie-based widget stores, and we hope to get their code submissions to kickstart this work. Community members exploring Apache Amber (incubating) for oAuth support within Wookie.Next steps:. Finish 0.9.0 release and move onto a 0.9.1 release. Continue to work and liase with other projects. Create a new "widget store" sub-project, aiming to bring in code submissions from ROLE and ITEC projects.Issues before graduation:. complete first release. build community/expand user base.Signed off by mentor: rgardler, ate.
