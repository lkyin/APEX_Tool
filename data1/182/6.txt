Openmeetings provides video conferencing, instant messaging, white.board, collaborative document editing and other groupware tools using.API functions of the Red5 Streaming Server for Remoting and Streaming.OpenMeetings entered the incubation on November 12, 2011.Summary:. Infrastructure and code clearance is done from the developer team and ready. to be reviewed. JARs are no more in our SVN and a first NOTICE file for. dependencies is written and to be discussed when the first official. Release Candidate is nominated. The Releas Candidate is basically ready. We are just working on some issues with the Flash Streaming Protocol's. variant "RTMPT", that is Flash Streaming over HTTP Tunneling. RTMPT is. just a fallback protocol and not the primary used in OpenMeetings. Nevertheless it is important to sort that out, as the Tunneling protocol. is needed for bypassing Firewalls. The RTMPT issue is basically a Red5. issue and we are hoping to either contribute or find other ways helping. Red5 community to sort it out. Our 3 official GSoC students are doing good and we have weekly meetings. where we discuss with them their projects. The results of the weekly. meetings are published to the developer mailing list. We have a 4th volunteering student that does his GSoC project even if not. accepted officially by Google. He does enhance the ATutor plugin for OCAD:. http://wiki.atutor.ca/display/atutorwiki/Google+Summer+of+Code+2012#GoogleSummerofCode2012-13.EnhanceIntegrationofATutorwithApacheOpenMeetingsWebConferencing. OCAD Devs have kindly contributed their existing Code under APL. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENMEETINGS-280) so that the. student can work on it and contribute his patches to the Apache. OpenMeetings. Community is growing, although not all people have found their way to. the new mailing list and website yet. But we think that will change as. soon as there is an announcement with a new release.Signed off by mentor: rgardler.Shepherd: Matt Franklin.
