Apache Drill is a distributed system for interactive analysis of large-scale.datasets that is based on Google's Dremel. Its goal is to efficiently process.nested data, scale to 10,000 servers or more and to be able to process.petabyes of data and trillions of records in seconds.Drill has been incubating since 2012-08-11.Three Issues to Address in Move to Graduation:. 1. Continue to attract new developers and and early users with a variety of. skills and viewpoints. 2. Continue to develop deeper community skills and knowledge by building. additional releases. 3. Demonstrate community robustness by rotating project tasks among. multiple project members. The community has made significant progress on items 1 and 2.Issues to Call to Attention of PMC or ASF Board:. none.How community has developed since last report:. Community awareness and participation were strengthened through a meeting. of the Bay Area Apache Drill User Group with over 100 participants locally. in San Jose and remotely via Cisco-hosted Webex. On site speakers included. 3 Drill contributors, two from San Jose and one from Seattle. http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Apache-Drill-User-Group/. Additional events include:. Code for 1st milestone release was posted and made available via. project website; release was socialized via mailing list, Twitter,. blogs and presentations. Several new full-time developers joined the project. Apache Drill received a Bossie award "Best open source big data tools". 17 September 2013 http://s.apache.org/B3H (infoworld.com. Mailing list discussions:. Subscriptions to the Drill mailing lists have risen to 415. There has. been active and increasing participation in discussions on the developer. mailing list, including new participants and developers. Participation. on the user list is growing although still small; mainly activity takes. place on developer mailing list.

Limit operator end-to-end. many focused discussions about 1st milestone release. Code. Total Commits from 01/09/2013 - 06/012/2013: 106. Detailed information regarding the commits is shown in this chart from. GitHub: http://s.apache.org/MnI (github.com. Nine contributors have participated in this GitHub code activity; there. have been 101 forks of the Apache Drill project on GitHub which is a. good indicator of strong interest outside the group of core. contributors. Code commits (during the period 01/09/2013 - 06/012/2013) include but. not limited to following:. Spooling batch buffer. Fix over memory pre-allocation within ParquetRecordReader. Implement simple metrics framework. prepare release drill-1.0.0-m1. Implement builders for Scan, Sort, LogicalPlan and PlanProp. Community Interactions. The weekly Drill hangout continues, conducted remotely through Google. hangouts Tuesday mornings 9am Pacific Time to keep core developers in. contact in realtime despite geographical separation. A Gdoc is being. updated regarding the discussions during hangout. http://s.apache.org/4Gc (docs.google.com. The community stays in touch through @ApacheDrill Twitter ID, and by. postings on various blogs including Apache Drill User. http://drill-user.org/ which has had several updates and through. international presentations at conferences. Viability of the community is also apparent as participants in the open. source Apache Drill community came together on November 4th meet-up of. the Bay Area Apache Drill User Group, with 391 members enrolled. The. group looked at how Drill works now and what will be the next steps in. the project. The event marked the recent first official release of the. Apache Drill project. Presentations.

Significant code drops have been checked in from a number of developers. to achieve Milestone 2 release. 4. New developers are contributing.Signed-off-by:. (drill) Ted Dunning. (drill) Grant Ingersoll. (drill) Sebastian Schelter.Shepherd notes:. Matt Franklin (mfranklin):. . I have reviewed the community and have concluded that it is very active and . healthy. IMO, #3 in the issues to address before graduation is not critical. and can be successfully mitigated by documenting the tasks that are currently . being executed by single individuals. My recommendation is that the Drill . podling begin the graduation process after completion of the next release. . Marvin Humphrey (marvin):. The report is admirably thorough and must have taken a long time to. prepare. Perhaps consider that a report with a reduced level of detail. similar to the other reports may be more in line with Board. expectations. The report was filed too late to be incorporated into a review by the. assigned shepherd. Please file on time. Please wrap future reports at 77 columns, and please take more care with. making indentation reflect logical hierarchy. Also, use only. s.apache.org URL shorteners in future reports. Otherwise, someone. downstream must clean up the report -- either someone from the IPMC (I. took care of reformatting this month) or the Board -- before it is. published in the official Board minutes.
