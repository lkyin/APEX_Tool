Description - Buildr is a build system for Java applications written in Ruby.Date of Entry - Nov. 2007.Community.The buildr community is transitioning from its older infrastructure to the Apache one. The code has been imported and committers work on the Apache SVN now. The migration of users from buildr-talk at google groups to buildr-user is also happening progressively.Development.Mostly bug fixes and small improvements. There's also work on JRuby support for which patches are submitted regularly from (for now) external contributors.Issues before graduation.First we need to fix the IP issues surrounding the Ruby license and our Ruby licensed dependencies before any release can be made. A thread has been started on general@i.a.o and another one is still running on legal-discuss@a.o but we've had few answers so far. We'll probably send a proposition and see if that's acceptable.
