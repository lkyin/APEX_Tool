(incubating since November 27th, 2009.Clerezza is a framework and set of components designed to make it easy to.build applications for the semantic and the social web.Graduation:. As in our last report in May, we believe Clerezza should graduate soon, but. unfortunately that hasn't happened yet. Activity is currently fairly low,. and it looks like Clerezza might remain a small/low activity project, but. the PPMC is functional, has done releases and invited additional committers. so there's no need to stay in the Incubator any longer once a plan to attempt . to grow the community is in place. . This plan has been discussed, and mostly involves better exposing Clerezza's . reusable components. The current docs mostly present the content management . aspects of Clerezza, which require adopting it as a whole, although several . modules are useful on their own for tasks related to RDF data and/or triple . stores. Making it clearer which modules are useful on their own should help . grow the community.How has the community developed since the last report:. No changes since last report.How has the project developed since the last report:. Some project restructuring to facilitate releasing individual modules.Next steps:. - Release individual modules. - Improve docs on reusing parts of Clerezza. - Graduate.Signed-off-by: jukka, bdelacretaz (mentorIPMC comments:. jukka: +1 to attempts to regain lost momentum.
