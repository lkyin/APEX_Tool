Lucene.Net was accepted into the Apache Incubator in February 2011.Originally it was a sub project of the Lucene Project.Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C# and.targeted at .NET runtime users. Lucene.Net has three primary goals:. - Maintain the existing line-by-line port from Java to C#, fully automating. and commoditizing the process such that the project can easily synchronize. with the Java Lucene release schedule. - High-performance C# search engine library. - Maximize usability and power when used within the .NET runtime. To that. end, it will present a highly idiomatic, carefully tailored API that. takes advantage of many of the special features of the .NET runtime.Recent Activity:. - Released 2.9.4g (generics version of 2.9.4) at the end of january.Current Activities:. - Lucene 3.0.3 porting is nearly complete. We have some bugs to work out,. and need to clean up our contrib projects a bit, but we hope to release. that within a month or two.Long term goals:. - Have a nearly fully automated process to convert Java Lucene to C#. (This has been a goal, but we are discussing if this is truely the best. idea of the project UPDATE: We have done some more investigative work. on this, but not much progress was made. - Parity with Java Lucene (4.0. - Have a new .NET version of Lucene utilizing .NET constructs and idioms.Graduation thought:. One of the mentors (Stefan Bodewig) has indicated he wants to start. pushing for graduation. UPDATE: Unfortunately, we have not made any. progress on this - hopefully we can have a more conclusive update next. check in. Our development/committers group is small, and work sometimes. happens in bursts and then stalls - something we need to work on a bit. The team has started to be more vocal about the project, for example a. blog has been added, and hopes to attract more contributors.Signed off by mentor: bodewig.
