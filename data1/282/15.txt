The Kitty Project is a lightweight, production focused, Java-based.application server performance diagnostic and management utility. Kitty.is written in Groovy.The project entered incubation on 2010-10-03.In order to get graduated, Kitty needs the following features:. - The ability to save profiles of commonly connected to jmx servers. including groups of tomcat servers. - The ability to collect metrics on an aggregate group of JMX servers.There are no issues that require the Incubator PMC's or the board's attention.The community hasn't grown since the last report.The project had some contribution as far as code is concerned, but the.mailing list had no new threads started nor old threads had new contributions.Changes were related to the management of the console output, and some.re-engineering in order to begin working on the missing features.Signed off by mentor: kevan.
