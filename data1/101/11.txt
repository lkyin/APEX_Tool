Empire-db is a relational data persistence component that aims to overcome the difficulties, pitfalls and restrictions inherent in traditional Object Relational Management (ORM) approaches Empire-db is on the Apache Incubator since July 2008.Recent activities:.Following a rather quiet period in April and May development activities have significantly improved in June and July. The main goal of the development team was to finally complete the release of the Empire-db-2.0.5 release including Maven project management. After an internal deadline had been set for code modifications, release permissions for the staging repository had to be acquired which took some extra time. It is our goal to finally complete staging and start voting on the release candidate within the next few days.Community aspects:.Recently code submissions from outside the current development team were received by users from different countries and backgrounds. The submissions are currently under review and are under consideration for an upcoming release. Another user offered his assistance in keeping project dependencies to Struts2 up to date. This gives us reasons to believe that the community is growing and demand for Empire-db is rising.
