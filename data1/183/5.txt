OpenNLP is a machine learning based toolkit for the processing of natural language text. It supports the most common NLP tasks, such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference resolution. These tasks are usually required to build more advanced text processing services.OpenNLP entered incubation on 11/23 2010.We started to integrate a couple of new features and will soon start testing for our second release at Apache.To solve our training data problem we created a proposal for an annotation project which suggest to label .AL 2.0 licensable text documents with semantic annotations.There is still good traffic on both the user and dev mailing list. .A list of the the most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. Resolve potential IP issues around releasing training models. Establish open regression tests for the parser and coreference component. Identify and encourage new contributors on the path to committership.Signed off by mentor: Grant Ingersoll.
