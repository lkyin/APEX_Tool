A wave is a hosted, live, concurrent data structure for rich communication. It.can be used like email, chat, or a document.Wave has been incubating since 2010-12-04.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. We are still working on first release. Several votes were. attempted, however, we were slowed down due to unfamiliarity with. release process and last second technical issues with the code. 2. Need to grow up community. 3. Make effort to lower entrance barrier for new contributors which. is pretty high due to steep learning curve.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?.None at this time.How has the community developed since the last report? While people.are in general interested in the software - we see traffic on demo.servers and bug reports, but we have only limited contribution by new.members.How has the project developed since the last report?.We had a few votes on the release - each time issues were found and.fixed. We are working on a new wiki for the project to allow new.contributors a better access to the project information. Also we.cleaned up the issues in Jira and categorized them in order to allow.potential contributors to find a potential task easier.Date of last release:. N/A.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?.July 2014.Signed-off-by:. (wave) Christian Grobmeier. (wave) Upayavira.Shepherd/Mentor notes:.
