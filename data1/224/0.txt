The Synapse project had a F2F meeting in Cupertino, CA to get initial views on direction and overall relationship to Axis2 etc. The notes are here. The community is slowly starting to discuss stuff and get going in the synapse-dev@ws.apache.org mailing list; since its only been a few weeks since the start it will take more time to get fully functional and effective.We expect to have a much more interesting report by the next F2F.
