Apache Wink is an incubating project that enables development and consumption of REST style web services The core server runtime is based on the JAX-RS (JSR 311) standard. The project also introduces a client runtime which can leverage certain components of the server-side runtime. Apache Wink will deliver component technology that can be easily integrated into a variety of environments. Wink has been incubating since May 2009.Notable activity in the Wink project:.Source base selected: Both IBM and HP contributed JAX-RS-based runtimes to the project. To get things rolling, one had to be selected as the basis of the trunk. After some discussion, the decision was to go with the HP runtime due to its maturity (runtime has been worked for at least 2 years) over the IBM code and the richness of features.JAX-RS 1.0 compliance: There was work done to get the JAX-RS 1.0 TCK up and running with Wink. Thanks to Dan Kulp from CXF for reaching out and helping the team get that working. Michael Elman led an effort to get the necessary JIRAs opened and addressed. In short order, we became JAX-RS 1.0 compliant on the new source base.58 JIRAs opened in a little over a month's time. Some of the were related to the JAX-RS 1.0 work. Others have been related to issues surfaced as the test bucket that IBM contributed has been ported over along with issues for making sure the runtime is Apache branded.Build automation was setup via Hudson with snapshot builds being updated in the maven repository.Things to resolve prior to graduating:.Need to create the first formal release after some JIRA issues are finished and some more ported tests are complete.Need to grow the user based community
