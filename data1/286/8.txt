iPMC Reviewers: jukkaNMaven develops plugins and integration for Maven to make building and using .NET languages a first-class citizen in Maven.Incubating since: 2006-11-17.Items to resolve before graduation.More active committer involvement. This involves getting a group of developers familiar with the NMaven internals (both .NET and Java), as well as growing a larger community of developers who are creating Maven plugins in .NET.Closer interaction with the Maven team.Status:.Added new committer: Evan Worley.Attempted to reach out to Lucene.NET (and other .NET projects external to ASF) but no response from any projects.There is some concern that NMaven may be drifting from Maven in terms of common architecture/code. Made (and making) active attempts to raise visibility of NMaven issues among general Maven developers by posting to maven dev list and submitting proposals for review.Plans:.Major IDE features.Preparing for a release.
