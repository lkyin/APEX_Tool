An infrastructure for cloud computing on big data.Tashi has been incubating since 2008-09-04.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. 2. 3.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?.How has the community developed since the last report?.How has the project developed since the last report?.Date of last release:. XXXX-XX-XX.Signed-off-by:. (tashi) Matthieu Riou. (tashi) Craig Russell.Shepherd notes:. rvs: Tashi looks completely dormant at this point. Despite my repeated. on-list and off-list emails it appears that I couldn't find anybody to. compile a report. The only discussion that resulted from my attempts is. captured over here: http://markmail.org/thread/mveeuubf2fcdmgcw. Personally I think we need to figure out a path to some kind of a. resolution here. I don't think Tashi benefits from being an incubator. project and we need to figure out how to get it to a different trajectory.
