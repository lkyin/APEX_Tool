Any23 is defined as a Java library, a Web service and a set of command line tools to extract and validate structured data in RDF format from a variety of Web documents and markup formats. Any23 is what it is informally named an RDF Distiller.A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation. 1. Port Any23 code to ASF infrastructure and update license headers. 2. Develop a strong community with organizational diversity and with strong connections to other relevant ASF communities. 3. At least one Any23 incubating release.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC), Tika PMC, or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.Yes, there has been ongoing work to bring the Any23 codebase to Apache SVN. The final stages include loading the code dump to the Apache test repos, there will then be a short time for the dev/committer team to review it, before loading it to the real repos. A time frame for this has been set at around a week. .How has the community developed since the last report?.Since our last report there have been no new committers. Development has also not been tremendously active however when the code migration finally completes this should improve.How has the project developed since the last report?.Any23 was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on October 1, 2011.As the code import has not yet been finalized, most of the project activity has been off-site, this includes changes to the codebase. There has been some interest from the Apache Nutch community to get an Any23/Nutch plugin operational, for details see NUTCH-1129. In addition there is now a healthy Jenkins nightly CI build running for the project. Issues in the short term are to discuss Paolo Castagna's points regarding the integration of more of the 'semantic web' projects which exist at Apache. .Signed off by mentor: mattmann.
