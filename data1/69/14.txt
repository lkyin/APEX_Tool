Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool,.including issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing.Bloodhound has been incubating since 2011-12-23.The most important issue the Bloodhound community needs to address.is diversifying the community, but we believe this is no longer.any impediment to graduation.We're hoping to graduate soon, before the next report. While.growing our community further continues to be important, we.have seen more outside interest recently. This addresses the.only barrier to graduation raised after the December2012 report.We have further prepared by completing the PODLINGNAMESEARCH,.and just recently completed the community vote on graduation.readiness.The project now has two online demo instances running of.Apache Bloodhound, one of which shows the current state of the.trunk branch [ http://bh-demo1.apache.org ] and providing.a first implementation of the new search functionality,.responsive layout and multi-product architecture that has.been developed. Together these represent the main strands of.what Apache Bloodhound set out to achieve. Unfortunately,.we do not yet have the ability to make use of the repository.browser, which was something that was brought up in the.previous report.We added two new committers to the project in January, and.a fourth incubation release. We have also seen more interest.in the project from a number of channels including irc and.the dev mailing list which we are, as ever, hoping to convert.into growth of the developer community and continue to improve.upon diversity.Please check this when you have filled in the report for Bloodhound.Signed-off-by:.Hyrum Wright: (bloodhoundGreg Stein: (bloodhoundBranko ÄŒibej: (bloodhound.P.S.: The Incubator vote to graduate Bloodhound passed on 2013-03-13.
