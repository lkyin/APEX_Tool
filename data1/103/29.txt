Etch was accepted into Incubator on 2 September 2008.Etch is a cross-platform, language- and transport-independent framework for building and consuming network services. The Etch toolset includes a network service description language, a compiler, and binding libraries for a variety of programming languages.For the last 3 months the main effort has been by Holger Grandy and Michael Fitzner, who contributed some bug fixes and have been converting documentation.The transition of current Etch Website to the new Apache CMS is in progress. Major parts of the sides are already available inside the CMS repository and can be seen at the staging area.The Spawn Labs team (Comer, Dixson) is working to integrate the c-binding into their product. They've been very quiet lately. We miss them. Comer wrote up something about his service cloud and is waiting for permission to publish it.Although progress is now visible, we still need to get more user and development activity on our lists. .Top issues currently are:.- plan features and dates for release 1.2 / 1.1.1.- work on further language bindings.- website transition to Apache CMS.- documentation.Note by Martijn Dashorst: I met with Holger Grandy and Michael Fitzner at FOSDEM'11 and we spoke about lots of stuff concerning Etch. I think the future for the podling is bright, but we need to get more people involved by publishing articles. The biggest problem is finding the right venues for publishing the articles. I'll bring Etch under the attention of PR to see if they have any good ideas.Signed off by mentor: dashorst.
