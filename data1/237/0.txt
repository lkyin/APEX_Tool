ADF Faces incubation has started in the last weeks The code repository has been setup, the committer access has been granted, we are now waiting for an import of a current code drop into the repository. This will take some time as all package names are changed over to an Apache like structure, and the ASL license is adopted as mentioned in the proposal. Mailing lists have been setup, and mailing list traffic is slowly picking up steam.
