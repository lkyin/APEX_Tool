Abdera has been incubating since May 2006 It is a framework for building Atom publishing protocol clients and servers.At the time of writing, Abdera is in the process of composing our graduation to TLP proposal for the Incubator PMC. Depending on how quickly that gets done we hope to have a proposal for the board for either the November or December meeting.Other than that progress is steady but slow. We have a continuing stream of minor issues and fixes, and a few relatively new committers who have been taking care of them. There has been little major progress but a fair amount of minor changes and fixes. All in all the project seems healthy and we anxiously await graduation and our next release, which should come soon afterwards.
