Olio is a web 20 toolkit to help developers evaluate the suitability, functionality and performance of various web technologies by implementing a reasonably complex application in several different technologies. The developers are working on a second release - 0.2. This release features more alignment between the different implementations, performance enhancements, code cleanup, bug fixes etc. This will be the first binary release for the Java implementation. Even without a kit release, the Java implementation already has several users. Olio is continuing to gain users and being used for diverse purposes.There are 30 subscribers to the user list and 30 subscribers to dev. There are over a hundred JIRA issues filed, and continuous activity toward closing them (about 26 open currently) Graduation From Incubation:.Diversity of committers is the primary issue with the project - we still need to work on recruiting more committers from different organizations.Signed off by mentor: Craig L Russell.
