The question has been raised as to the future of JSR-326 and the Apache Kato podling, the options being to keep both or continue only with one of them.The following is planned for next reporting period:. Decide in what form the podling should continue, if at all.Before this project can graduate we need to encourage more participation in the project and grow the community.Signed off by mentor: ant.Sadly Kato seems still to be set on a holding pattern. - Robert Burrell Donkin.
