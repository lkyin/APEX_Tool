Empire-db has been accepted to the incubator in July 2008 While ths SVN repository had soon been set up and development progressed there has until now not been an official Apache release with the packages containting the org.apache namespace and with all legal files available and in the right place.Recent activity:.The main concern of the Empire-db committers in the previous month has been the acceptance of the first official Apache release by members of the incubator PMC. Due to legal concerns about the inclusion of two .jar files the distribution was first changed to go without them which however resulted in compilation problems with the build files provided. After a long discussion period the two jars which were taken from a Tomcat distribution where included again and release candidate 2 of Empire-db 2.0.4 and Struts2-extentions 1.0.4 were again put up for voting. Finally the release got accepted incubator PMC. The accepted distribution files will now be offered for download from the Empire-db website. (Yet to be done.Meanwhile a few improvement and bufixing tasks have already been opened for the upcoming 2.0.5 release.Community aspects:.Slowly the empire-user mailing list is getting used by uses not belonging to the empire-db development team. A few mail requests have been answered. With the now accepted official Apache release we hope that we can now further increase the community.
