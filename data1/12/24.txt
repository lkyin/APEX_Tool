ECharts is a charting and data visualization library written in JavaScript.ECharts has been incubating since 2018-01-18.Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:.Status page ( https://incubator.apache.org/projects/echarts.html ) has not been updated and we are going to do this within a month.Official Website: We have redirected echarts.baidu.com to echartsjs.com and put a banner in echartsjs.com stating that the official Website is echarts.apache.org but we still need to come to a conclusion about whether CDN still has a problem with the access in China. If so, we should probably make echartsjs.com as a mirror site with a clear specification about the main site. If not, we should redirect echartsjs.com to echarts.apache.org.Currently the collaborator of echarts npm package is ecomfe and we should move it to echarts.Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?.No.How has the community developed since the last report?.More people from the community become contributors, either in the form of answering questions in the issues, fixing the document or making pull requests with the code.
