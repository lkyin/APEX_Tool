Create a release. 2. Activate some community. 3.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. There is an ongoing discussion since first quarter 2016 about how to deal. with this project, because no release happened yet and there's only little. activity regarding development and support. Especially no release is a. problem for incubating projects.How has the community developed since the last report?. One support question, no new project members.How has the project developed since the last report?. Robert Middleton finished his attempt to move the project to use C++. smart pointers instead of the former used custom implementation. That. work needs to be tested and integrated upstream, but there's no time plan. currently on when this will be done.How would you assess the podling's maturity?. It seems this project has run its course in the incubator. The Logging PMC. needs to decide what to do with the project. Initial setup. Working towards first release. Community building.
