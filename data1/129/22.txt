Code generation for decimal and timestamp types has been added to the text scanner, increasing the performance of some queries by up to 19%. More robust query plans in case of data skew have made some aggregations eight times as fast. A number of large changes are in-flight, including changes to equivalence class computation in the planner, more decimal semantics adjustments, min-max filters for Kudu, and multi-threaded metadata loading that increases the performance of some metadata operations by 8x.How would you assess the podling's maturity?.Please feel free to add your own commentary.
