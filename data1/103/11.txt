Signed off by: niclas, dashorst.Etch was accepted into Incubator on 2 September 2008. We had our first birthday!.Etch is a cross-platform, language- and transport-independent framework for building and consuming network services. The Etch toolset includes a network service description language, a compiler, and binding libraries for a variety of programming languages.Diaspora!.Most all of the Cisco-based Etch team found themselves unemployed by Cisco this quarter. So this quarter has been marked with little technical progress as the team members find new homes for themselves. Despite the disruption, Youngjin has begun to pickup on the C-binding work started by James DeCocq.Release 1.1 is ready but needs some administrative polish before it is done.Release 1.2 is next in the pipeline.Our problem with finding a home for our continuous build continues. Various plans have been proposed and failed due to lack of a Windows-friendly c# build environment. We need to find a place do public builds.Outstanding items:.More community. we have been Cisco-centered with just a few nibbles outside of Cisco. Things are definitely changing with members employed or so to be employed in different places. Building a stronger community over the next several months is our key task.
