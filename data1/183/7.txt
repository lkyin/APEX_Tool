OpenNLP is a machine learning based toolkit for the processing of natural language text. It supports the most common NLP tasks, such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference resolution. These tasks are usually required to build more advanced text processing services.OpenNLP entered incubation on 11/23 2010.We almost finished the development for our next release (1.5.2) and second release in the Incubator and will start testing it soon.The development team is still active and most of the changes have been done by four independent committers.This week Boris Galitsky proposed on the mailing list to contribute a component for syntactic generalization which we will hopefully be able to accept.Furthermore we started to work on tooling for an annotation project in our sandbox and hope to be able to attract new contributors through this effort.A list of the the most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. Establish open regression tests for the parser and coreference component. Identify and encourage new contributors on the path to committership.Signed off by mentor: Grant Ingersoll.
