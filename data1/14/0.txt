Apache Flagon is a generalized user behavioural logging platform for web pages and thin-client applications.Apache Flagon has been incubating since 2016-07-13; Apache Flagon has officially changed its name from Apache SensSoft.Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:.Accelerate release frequency and reduce branch complexity in repos to reduce adoption, contributor disincentives.Grow the Apache Flagon Committer/Contributor/Community Base around our core product Apache UserALE.js (IncubatingComplete the issues highlighted at the Apache Flagon Roadmap [1].Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?.Apache Flagon is currently suffering from unresponsive mentors:.Dave Meikle has been active and engaged, aside from a prolonged outage due to a long-term illness. We are grateful for Dave's help and assistance since then.Lewis McGibbney has been uncharacteristically unresponsive on dev@, private@, and to PM. Note that Lewis has been a champion for us and have confidence that he will return to activity.Atri Sharma has been wholly inactive. We tried to report this in our last Q1 report; when posted to dev@ for review, he maintained that he didn't the ability to cast binding VOTEs as an excuse for non-engagement. We softened the language in our Q1 report and encouraged him to participate by providing guidance, mentorship, and engaging in community VOTEs. We haven't heard from him since despite numerous requests for help and support posted to private@.As a result of long periods of mentor absence:.ReRelease of v1.0.0 (at IPMC ) was delayed until mentors (Dave) were available to guide us through a potential copyright issue (resolved.Prolonged the process of our name change as we struggled to explore Apache documentation and understand what we had to change (in process; HUGE thanks to INFRA for assisting us with some of the details.Is presently impeding our release process (not enough binding VOTES) after tightening release procedures, and working hard to clean up our branch structure to increase this cadence.We have struggled to get timely IPMC sign-off on REPORTs and have been unable to post these ourselves to the incubator wiki for lack of permission.We have had to abandon our prior NPM distribution as it was released by a non-responsive mentor on their personal NPM account (we don't have credentials [2].NOTE as of the date of REPORT (6/26/2019) our ReRelease of Apache Flagon UserALE.js (Incubating) v1.0.0 has been under VOTE on general@ for 9 days (6/17/2019 After community and PPMC VOTE, we needed +2 binding votes. We received helpful comments from Justin McLean, but despite numerous reminders to VOTE, we still have yet to receive the last +1 binding VOTE from IPMC. We are concerned that without active mentors, our release cadence will remain slow and unresponsive to user communities.With Dave Meikle's help, we will be searching for two additional mentors so that our community is self sufficient. We recommend dropping Atri Sharma from the project for non-participation.How has the community developed since the last report?.The community has:.improved release processes and code base to expedite future releases [3,4].gathered a wide base of users that are eagerly anticipating UserALE.js v2.0.0 via NPM (under VOTE within the community as of this date.discussed with external parties research applications with university research labs in machine learning and social computing.the community has organically grown with a new contributor, who is participating in VOTEs.the community expects to complete major updates to documentation on website and READMEs, in early JUL 2019. Wiki updates will complete shortly thereafter.Despite consistent challenges to our community throughout 2018, we are showing signs of growth, continue to have a relevant project, and are well postured to accelerate growth in the coming quarters. We remain committed to learning and adopting the Apache Way.How has the project developed since the last report?.Completed migration to GitBox Repos.Project maturity roadmaps (Wiki) and version release plans (JIRA) continue to be maintained.JIRA boards continue to be maintained.Core product source code for front-end and back-end assets has been steadily maintained and modernized.How would you assess the podling's maturity?.Please feel free to add your own commentary. Initial setup. Working towards first release. Community building.Date of last release:.2018-03-14.When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?.Arthi Vezhavendan was added to Committer base on 2017-01-24.Dave Meikle was added to PPMC on 2018-11-24.Atri Sharma was added to PPMC on 2018-11-24.Have your mentors been helpful and responsive or are things falling.through the cracks?.See mentorship issues above.We are now aware that we can lean on general@ or INFRA for support without permission and have deepened our knowledge of Apache processes so that committers are more self-sufficient.Signed-off-by:. (flagon) Dave Meikle.Comments: Great to have two releases out post the name change. Now we need to work on improving the mentor situation and on building the community.[1] https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLAGON/Roadmaps.[2] https://www.npmjs.com/package/useralejs.[3] https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/flagon/.[4] https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLAGON/UserALE.js+Release+Manage ment+Procedure.IPMC/Shepherd notes:.Justin Mclean: All PPMC members in the roster have permission to edit the incubator report, you don't need to rely on mentors for that.
