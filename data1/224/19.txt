Synapse development continues apace, and we proposed graduation, but based on concerns about the amount of discussion on mailing lists, decided to hold off from graduation Much of discussion was happening in weekly IRC chats, and there was very little collateral discussion from the IRC participants, and certainly not from non-participants. We agreed to cancel the weekly IRCs and emphasize the use of e-mail, except in specific circumstances where IRC chats are felt to be useful.As regards development, we continue to move towards our agreed upon 1.0 feature set. Since the last report we have gained another active participant and we continue to improve the codebase. We plan to do another release over the next month.
