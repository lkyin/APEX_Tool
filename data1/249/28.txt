iPMC Reviewers: jukkaWoden is a Java class library for reading, validating, manipulating, creating and writing WSDL documents, initially to support WSDL 2.0 and with the longer term aim of supporting past, present and future versions of WSDL.Incubating since: 2005.In April, we released Milestone 7a to support the Axis2 1.2 release. This was a minor update to M7 released in February.The M8 release is now under development. This will add full support for WSDL2 assertions (the non-schema validation rules) and will improve Woden's WSDL extensions API. M8 will likely be ready around late June / early July, around the time the spec could be moving to a full W3C Recommendation. With M8, the project should achieve it's first primary goal which was to support the W3C WSDL2 working group's efforts by providing a compliant implementation of the spec.Post-M8 goals are to exit incubation and to review and stabilize the API so that we can ship a 1.0 release. Other functional requirements include WSDL serialization and support for WSDL 1.1.The team has been addressing the following issues regarding exiting incubation:.building our public key presence on the Apache web of trust.adding developer documentation to the web site (to doattempting to grow the developer community (3 potential contributors unrelated to existing committers. 2 have submitted code already. The 3rd was a Google Summer of Code prospect whose GSoC proposal (Woden serialization) was rejected, but he's still keen to contribute this function.
