Kato was accepted into the Incubator on 6 November 2008.Kato is a project to develop the Specification, Reference Implementation, and TCK for JSR 326: the JVM Post-mortem Diagnostics API.Kato is just starting up; most of the infrastructure work has now been done; mailing lists, SVN, JIRA etc. created. Most initial committer user IDs have been requested, still waiting on the last couple of CLAs.The next steps for Kato are agreeing the highest level user stories that will drive the JSR design and seeding the repository with the code contributed by IBM.
