Tashi has been incubating since September 2008.The Tashi project aims to build a software infrastructure for cloud computing on massive internet-scale datasets (what we call Big Data The idea is to build a cluster management system that enables the Big Data that are stored in a cluster/data center to be accessed, shared, manipulated, and computed on by remote users in a convenient, efficient, and safe manner.Development activities have included adding a locality and layout service, integrating metrics into ganglia for monitoring, more complicated network isolation support, and preliminary code for the purpose of communicating with Maui, a cluster scheduler. Additionally, the documentation has been enhanced on the project webpage.The project is still struggling to grow a substantial user community, but there are several active contributors. We are looking forward to the opportunity to present our work with PRS and Hadoop at SC'09 [1]. In addition, Tashi is deployed at Intel's [OpenCirrus] [2] site where it has more than 20 users. It is also being installed at CMU's [OpenCirrus] site.Items to be resolved before graduation:.Prepare and review a release candidate.Develop community diversity (currently Intel and CMU committers[1] http://scyourway.nacse.org/conference/view/tut168.[2] http://opencirrus.org/.
