Gora is an ORM framework for column stores such as Apache HBase and Apache Cassandra with a specific focus on Hadoop.A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation. 1. Port Gora code and license headers into ASF license headers. 2. Develop a strong community with organizational diversity and with infection into existing ASF projects like Nutch and Hadoop. . 3. At least one Gora incubating release .Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.No, not at this time.How has the community developed since the last report?.Ever since the 0.1-incubating release, it's been kind of quiet. We did have a couple users (Yves Langisch, Joseph Vychtrle, Ioannis Canellos, and Marshall Pierce) pop on, report some issues, and help out. .How has the project developed since the last report?.Gora was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on September 26, 2010.The 0.1-incubating release is out. We're currently working on a 0.1.1-incubating patch that includes an update to Gora-Hbase that will allow us to upgrade our existing jars on Maven Central. Once we roll 0.1.1 (Chris Mattmann will RM it), Nutch 2.0-trunk will upgrade to the Gora release shortly thereafter.Signed off by mentor: mattmann .
