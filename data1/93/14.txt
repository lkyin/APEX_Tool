Apache DeviceMap is a data repository containing device information, images and other relevant information for all sorts of mobile devices, e.g. smartphones and tablets. While the focus is initially on that data, APIs will also be created to use and manage it.DeviceMap has been incubating since 2012-01-03.It looks like DeviceMap needs to be rebooted - there's almost zero activity from the initial committers, but a few people have proposed contributions that could help restart with a mostly new set of committers (without kicking existing ones out of course - they're welcome to be more active if they're willing and able.Two committer/PPMC elections are pending, and with two active mentors this can provide the embryo of a new community.The podling could be considered a failure at this point, but giving it another chance does no harm, so we recommend trying that.Please check this when you have filled in the report for DeviceMap.Signed-off-by:.Bertrand Delacretaz: (devicemapKevan Miller: (devicemapAndrew Savory: (devicemap.Shepherd notes:.
