SAMOA provides a collection of distributed streaming algorithms for the most.common data mining and machine learning tasks such as classification,.clustering, and regression, as well as programming abstractions to develop.new algorithms that run on top of distributed stream processing engines.(DSPEs It features a pluggable architecture that allows it to run on.several DSPEs such as Apache Storm, Apache Flink, and Apache Samza.SAMOA has been incubating since 2014-12-15.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Grow the community. 2. Elect new PMC members. 3. Release more often.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. None.How has the community developed since the last report?. Mailing list activity (March 2016 - May 2016):. @dev: 202 messages. Jira issues backlog (March 2016 - May 2016):. Created: 3. Resolved: 9. We have a number of new users showing up on the mailing list, which is. encouraging.How has the project developed since the last report?. After the decision taken by the community to drop support for S4, we. removed the support for S4. We fixed automatic build issues, we simplified. input from HDFS, and we worked on adding support for Apache Gearpump. Two. talks were given to advertise Apache SAMOA, one at ApacheCon NA Big Data. by Nicolas Kourtellis, and another one at the "J on the beach" conference. by Albert Bifet.Date of last release:. 2015-07-21.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?. None.Signed-off-by:. (samoa) Alan Gates. (samoa) Ashutosh Chauhan. (samoa) Enis Soztutar. (samoa) Ted Dunning.Shepherd/Mentor notes:. Alan Gates:. I sent a mail to the community poking on the long wait since. the last release and whether they think there will be a release. soon. I also expressed my concern on not having added any. committers and asked if there were any contributors who looked. like they might be a good candidate for committership.
