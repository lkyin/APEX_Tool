The ALOIS project team wrote an private e-mail to it's mentors shortly after the last report. They have told us that due to personal reasons they cannot keep this project alive and there will be no project activity in near future. We have agreed to wait until the June 2011 comes up. So far there is no change in project activity or interest, no e-mails and even no more private messages. After this report the Incubator-PMC needs to discuss about moving this podling to attic. (Christian Grobmeier.In addition to Christian's report, I'd like to mention that we didn't find any interest in the project outside of our small group, although we did quite a lot requests off list. If there would be someone to take over the project, we would be happy to give a helping hand at the start. (Urs Lerch.Signed off by mentor: grobmeier.
