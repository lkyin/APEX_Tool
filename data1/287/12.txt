NPanday allows projects using the .NET framework to be built with.Apache Maven. NPanday has been incubating since August 2010.Discussion has been low over the holiday period, but steady work has been.put into knocking issues marked for the next releases. There are very few.left, and a good number of fixes complete, so a release should come quite.shortly. This would be a good opportunity to focus on a graduation plan,.and to better promote the project among the .NET and Maven communities.and increase the number of users and contributors.We continue to see small growth in users, and occasional patch submissions,.but haven't added a new committer in a while.The top priorities towards graduation are:. - work out a concrete plan towards graduation in the next quarter. - encourage newer contributors to do so on a continuing basis.There are no issues for the Incubator PMC or board at this time.Signed off by mentor: Dennis Lundberg.
