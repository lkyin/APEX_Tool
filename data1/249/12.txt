The WSDL 20 processor being developed by this incubator project is progressing according to the Milestone plan on the Woden web site. We are still aiming for an initial release around April 2006 and hopefully, promotion from incubation. M2 delivered December 9th includes most of the WSDL parsing logic and about one third of the WSDL validation. M3 due January 20th will complete the parsing logic and most of the validation. Web site documentation and expansion of the junit test suite are also due in M3. Other goals of the project will be addressed after M3. So far, the code has been developed by two committers, both from IBM. M2 was the first code base suitable for broader participation. We have two potential contributors from other organizations who have offered help recently and the Woden wiki now has a list of the main outstanding tasks that need to be completed. We will be liaising more closely with those potential contributors to expand the collaboration on the project.Another key development is that the WSDL 2.0 became a W3C Candidate Recommendation on January 6, 2006. We are likely to see increased participation in Woden and engage in interoperability testing with other implementations.
