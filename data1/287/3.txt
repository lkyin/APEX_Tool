NPanday allows projects using the .NET framework to be built with Apache Maven. NPanday allows .NET projects to be converted into Maven projects thus allowing them to fully utilize the other technologies driven by Maven. NPanday has been incubating since August 2010.In our previous report (February 2011), we stated that we've staged the NPanday-1.3-incubating release. However, there were a couple of issues that we needed to address so we decided to not push through with it. .After addressing those issues, we've staged the NPanday-1.4.0-incubating release for vote which includes the following issues:. Visual Studio 2010 and .Net 4.0 Framework support. Removal of UAC and PAB directories. Updated groupIds of all NPanday components including plugins to "org.apache.npanday".This release is still waiting for other committers and mentors to test and get the required binding votes.Updated documentation was successfully deployed in http://incubator.apache.org/npanday/docs/1.4.0-incubating/index.html.Code licenses and license headers have all been reviewed and pass RAT.IP clearance was completed.We have voted a new committer in the person of John Fallows and we also have a new mentor, Matthias Wessendorf.The top priorities towards graduation are:. complete 1.4.0-incubating release. guide regular patch contributors towards becoming committers. improve engagement of existing committers.There are no issues for the Incubator PMC or board at this time.Signed off by mentor: Dennis Lundberg.
