(pinot) Felix Cheung.Comments: good progress. how can we grow more committers? also dev@ traffic is very light - only 9 threads in the last 3 months.IPMC/Shepherd notes:.Dave Fisher - I see the start of a VOTE for a committer on private@ There has been no response from other PPMC members. That is disappointing. This could be because most of the PPMC members are not subscribed to private@. This includes one of the Mentors who signed off on the report.Justin Mclean: The items listed under community development seem more about project development. How has the community developed? I'd also like to see answer to all questions, it make it hard to judge process and for us to help if information is not supplied.
