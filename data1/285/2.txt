MRQL is a query processing and optimization system for large-scale, distributed data analysis, built on top of Apache Hadoop and Hama.MRQL has been incubating since 2013-03-13.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Complete the first release. a) Ensure proper transfer of code. b) Verify distribution rights. 2. Establish whether "Apache MRQL" is a suitable name.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.none.How has the community developed since the last report?.We have posted a project description on the HadoopSphere blog, which.initiated some discussion and interest. Since the last report, there.was little activity in recruiting new users and developers, but we are.very close to completing the first release. We believe that, as soon.as we make the first release available, many users will start using.the system, will request bug fixes, improvements, and additional.functionality, and will become new contributors.How has the project developed since the last report?.We are in the process of completing the MRQL codebase to make it ready.for the first release, which we expect to take place in the next few.weeks. The only major component missing that delays this release is.switching to maven as our project management tool. We believe that.using maven is important because it will facilitate contributions by.(and recruitment of) committers and will ease version management. The.reasons for the delay are: 1) no one of the current developers has.prior experience with maven 2) the codebase is non-standard because it.uses non-standard tools to generate Java code.Date of last release: .none yet.Please check this when you have filled in the report for MRQL.Signed-off-by: .Alan Cabrera: (mrqlAnthony Elder: (mrqlAlex Karasulu: (mrqlMohammad Nour El-Din: (mrql.Shepherd notes:.
