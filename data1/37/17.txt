Singa is a distributed deep learning platform.Singa has been incubating since 2015-03-17.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Grow the community. One committer was added in July, more would be. nominated soon after releasing V1.0. We are also expanding the user. base by participating in meetups of local organizations, including. PyDataSG. 2. Optimize V1 release in terms of memory and efficiency for both. stand-alone training and distributed training. 3. Add more examples and tutorials to attract users, including deployment. on Android phones.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?.
