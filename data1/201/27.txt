River is aimed at the development and advancement of the Jini technology core infrastructure Jini technology is a service oriented architecture that defines a programming model which both exploits and extends Java technology to enable the construction of secure, distributed systems which are adaptive to change. River has been incubating since December 2006.Recently there has been increased activity in River's development process with the arrival of three new Committer's, Jonathan Costers, Peter Firmstone and Tom Hobbs.AR2 is almost ready for release, and the committers are learning how to use the testing framework from Sun, and gradually move things to JUnit or more commonly understood testing systems.For testing reasons, additional server resources might be requested for the jtreg and integration tests; An HTTP proxy (River-306) and KDC server (River-307) are necessary.The decision was made to allow developers to use Java 5 new language features and change the com.sun.jini. and com.artima. namespaces to org.apache.river. (River-261) after the release of AR2.Efforts are being made for preservation of existing documentation, mail lists and River dependent projects that currently exist outside of River. Sun is closing Jini and RMI mailing lists, including the archives, which contains a wealth of information.Consolidation of external Jini projects was discussed as optional add-ons, this discussion is still open, pending River incubation graduation.Mentor's (Niclas) additional reporting; It is good to see new fresh blood getting active in the community and a more positive atmosphere is starting to emerge, and I think the worries in the previous report is decreasing.
