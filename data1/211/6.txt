Apache SIS is a toolkit that spatial information system builders or users can use to build applications containing location context. This project will look to store reference implementations of spatial algorithms, utilities, services, etc. as well as serve as a sandbox to explore new ideas. Further, the goal is to have Apache SIS grow into a thriving Apache top-level community, where a host of SIS/GIS related software (OGC datastores, REST-ful interfaces, data standards, etc.) can grow from and thrive under the Apache umbrella. Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.Development progress has really slowed, and there isn't much mailing list activity. Nothing to.stop the project for (yet), but something to keep an eye on. Community progress since the last report.Development and mailing list activity have significantly slowed down.This is a small core set of committers and community though. It would be.great to get some new blood and folks interested in the project.I still believe that we should try and target a 0.2-incubating release with.a layer service and some basic integration with Apache Tika (a GDAL parser is.being worked on in that community with an eye towards integration into SIS.Also we are looking at Apache OODT as a mechanism for geospatial storage and.persistence.The ESRI interest mentioned in the last board report hasn't really gone anywhere. Project progress since last report.SIS was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on February 21, 2010.Development progress has been pretty much nil. Chris hopes to start work on the.layer service this quarter, but again, it would be great to have some new blood.here. Folks that are interested in geospatial services, data presentation, and.such would be much welcomed within the project.Signed off by mentor: mattmann, greddin, kevan.
