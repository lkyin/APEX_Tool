Celix is an OSGi like implementation in C with a distinct focus on.interoperability between Java and C.Celix has been incubating since 2010-11-02.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Grow the community. 2. Find more committers. 3. Publish a new release.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. None.How has the community developed since the last report?. Several new people are working on additional code for the project. One. person is working on a GSoC project, someone else is working on a new. remote services protocol and is actively communicating over the list and. using jira to post patches. Overall this is an increase in activity. The Native-OSGi project is still progressing, but rather slow. So there. isn't anything new on that end. Celix is still the reference. implementation, so I still expect this to be a great drive for Celix, for. the code as well as the committers.How has the project developed since the last report?. As mentioned above, a student is working on a GSoC project and has. implemented an Event Admin which will be included in Celix. Also a. additional Remote Services implementation based on shared memory is being. made. Work for a new release is still ongoing, the focus is slightly changing,. one of the main users has requested a release. Since they don't use. Win32, Win32 support can be stripped from the release plan and postponed. to a later release.Date of last release:. 16-12-2012.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?. 2013-01-07 Roman Shaposhnik joins as a mentor. 2012-03-20 Pepijn elected as committer.Signed-off-by:.
