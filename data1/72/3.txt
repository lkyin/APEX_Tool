We completed https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PODLINGNAMESEARCH-51. and concluded that Optiq was not a viable name. We agreed (via PPMC vote and consensus on dev) that Calcite was suitable new. name, and logged https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PODLINGNAMESEARCH-56,. which has been approved by legal. Now we are part way through renaming;. see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-8413.
