Chukwa is a log collection and analysis framework for Apache Hadoop clusters.Chukwa has been incubating since 2010-07-14.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Generating an active community. 2. Keep code up-to-date with Hadoop trend. 3. Make another release.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware.of?. Chukwa code needs to be maintained to keep up with new versions of Hadoop.How has the community developed since the last report?. Committers are communicating more actively than previous quarter.How has the project developed since the last report?. More contributors have open JIRA to request features and experiment with. code base. Website is now svnpubsub enabled. Team member list is updated. with new committers. Javadocs are regenerated to remove frame injection. vulnerability.Date of last release:. January 2012.Signed-off-by:. (chukwa) Alan Cabrera. (chukwa) Anthony Elder. (chukwa) Bernd Fondermann. (chukwa) Jukka Zitting.Shepherd notes:. ant: I'm a mentor not sheperd but i'll add some comments here. I think we. should just graduate Chukwa. They have met all documented Incubator. requirements, the only reason they're not graduated is that there isn't. loads of development activity going on. Other low activity podlings have. graduated before, Wink is a good example, or Steve which didn't even. incubate. Chukwa has been incubating for 3 years so aren't just some. fly-by-night thing, the "How has the project developed since the last. report?" section of this report shows there is work going on, and that they. fixed the javadoc frame injection security vulnerability shows they do jump. to it when issues that need to be addressed arise. We're not adding any. value to the podling by keeping it here in the Incubator, we should graduate. them, perhaps including the mentors on the PMC if that helps alleviate any. worries.
