Brooklyn is a framework for modeling, monitoring, and managing applications.through autonomic blueprints.Brooklyn has been incubating since 2014-05-01.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Performing our first release under Apache. 2. Grow the community. 3. More diversity of the committers/PPMC (currently biased towards. employees of a single organization.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. None.How has the community developed since the last report?. Our community continues to grow slowly but surely, and has received. contributions from new community members that are significant and. highly interesting to our project.How has the project developed since the last report?. No major changes from the last report; we are well-settled into our. new home and commits are being made at a regular rate. Preparation for. our first release continues. We neglected to mention in last month's report about the completion of. a code grant for the "camp-server" component. This is a crucial. component of Brooklyn, and deserves its place in Brooklyn, rather than. an external dependency where we would have no control over release. schedules and bug fixing. So we are grateful to the donor, Cloudsoft,. for passing this component to Apache Brooklyn.Date of last release:. No releases under Apache yet.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?. No change since 2014-07-02.Signed-off-by:. (brooklyn) Matt Hogstrom. (brooklyn) Alex Karasulu. (brooklyn) David Nalley. (brooklyn) Marcel Offermans. (brooklyn) Jean-Baptiste Onofr√©.
