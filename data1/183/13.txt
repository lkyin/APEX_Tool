The Apache OpenNLP library is a machine learning based toolkit for the.processing of natural language text. Incubating since November, 2011.It supports the most common NLP tasks, such as tokenization, sentence.segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity extraction, chunking,.parsing, and coreference resolution. These tasks are usually required to.build more advanced text processing services. OpenNLP also includes maximum.entropy and perceptron based machine learning.The team was extended by two new committers, Boris Galitsky and Aliaksandr.Autayeu. We worked towards our graduation and had a positive community and.recommendation vote.Our community became more active and we saw a couple of new faces.on the user and development mailing list. .Signed off by mentor:.
