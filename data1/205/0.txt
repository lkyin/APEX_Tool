Mailing lists, subversion and Jira are setup and we're currently working on getting the remaining bits of the infrastructure running like the website etc. The CLAs for all initial committers have been recorded and accounts are pending. The software grant for Sanselan has been received and the code base will be committed to svn as soon as the accounts are created.
