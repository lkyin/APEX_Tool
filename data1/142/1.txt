(introduced to Apache incubator on Jul 4, 2011Kafka provides an extremely high throughput distributed publish/subscribe messaging system. Additionally, it supports relatively long term persistence of messages to support a wide variety of consumers, partitioning of the message stream across servers and consumers, and functionality for loading data into Apache Hadoop for offline, batch processing.A list of the most important issues to address in the move towards graduation. 1. Successful podling release. 2. Invite diverse new active committers.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.Not at this time.How has the community developed since the last report?.Mailing list traffic for July-August-September[12th] (user: 40, 65, 19; dev: 116, 371, 63) both show healthy growth trends. Qualitatively the -dev discussion has trended away from topics like "how should we configure Jira?" to "What's the best way to deal with multiple language bindings?". Several patches were submitted by first time contributors.How has the project developed since the last report?.The general theme over the past month has been polish: fixing bugs, better unit tests, getting log levels right, build system cleanup etc.Signed off by mentor:.Alan Cabrera.
