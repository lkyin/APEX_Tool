The Training project aims to develop resources which can be used for training purposes in various media formats, languages and for various Apache and non-Apache target projects.Training has been incubating since 2019-02-21.Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:.Promote the information about Apache Training Project with increased participation from community.Create a tutorial on how the tools provided by this project can be used to create own content.Review current policies around contribution review and releases to find a pragmatic compromise.Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?.There currently is a lack of involvement by the PPMC in the project which caused stagnation in mailing list participation and overall project progress. The PPMC is currently taking steps to address this by focusing on promoting new committers and being more involved again.The current review and release process seems to be overly complex and scary and hampers contributions. Discussions around relaxing this are ongoing.How has the community developed since the last report?.Activity on the dev list has declined since the last report, total number of posts was November 37, December 13, January (to be updated) 84.How has the project developed since the last report?.We have refactored the Maven structure to make adding new projects much easier by using an archetype, this should help make the project more accessible to a lot of people.ApacheCon themed templates are under development that will be available for speakers at future conferences.An introductory Hadoop slide deck was contributed and is currently undergoing review.How would you assess the podling's maturity?.There are currently some issues with this podling that we are working to address, we believe that the issues are not yet critical and can be turned around from within the community but want to make the board aware of this early on. Community building.Date of last release:.No new releases as ongoing discussions around the Pixabay license in LEGAL-479 have been blocking releases for months now.When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?.Voting is currently ongoing to add a new committer to the projects roster.Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?.Mentors have been responsive and helpful when reached out to.Is the PPMC managing the podling's brand / trademarks?.The name search process has not yet been started, as there is still time to do that if and when graduation draws nearer.
