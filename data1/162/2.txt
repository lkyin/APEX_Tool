Mnemonic is a Java based non-volatile memory library for in-place structured.data processing and computing.Mnemonic has been incubating since 2016-03-03.On 05/24/2016, we released our first official build at https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/incubator/mnemonic/0.1.2-incubating/.Various metrics for May are as follows: (5/3-5/31/2016 +##--+. | Metric | counts |. +##--+. | Non Merge Commits | 23 |. | Contributors | 3 |. | Jira New Issues | 18 |. | Resolved Issues | 18 |. | Pull Requests merged | 0 |. | Pull Requests proposed | 0 |. +##--+.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Apache releases: Community voted and released Mnemonic-0.1.2-incubating. 2. Expand and build strong community, keep active dev list discussions. 3. Develop new features: We are working in Native computing layer design.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.How has the community developed since the last report?. Yanping and Gary presented Mnemonic project at ApacheCon Big Data. Conference. Yanping presented at In-Memory Computing Summit. Both talks. were well received. Several developers approached us to ask additional. details on how Mnemonic worked for Spark. They are interested to see if we. are able to successfully integrate Mnemonic into other projects. While we are focusing on develop new features, we will try to contact. other projects' communities to explore integration opportunities. As the. official release is done this month, for the next 3 months we expect. integration activities will be increased.How has the project developed since the last report?. We have been focusing the first Apache release over the past weeks. We also explored ideas on design native computing layer which will further. enhance durable Java object model on large non-volatile memory.Date of last release:. 2016-05-24.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?. No election, the project is still in early stage of developing.Signed-off-by:. (mnemonic) Patrick Hunt. (mnemonic) Andrew Purtell. (mnemonic) James Taylor. (mnemonic) Henry Saputra.
