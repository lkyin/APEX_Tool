After the M1 release in December, Synapse had a slow start to the year However, recently the project has restarted in full vigor with some key design improvements to make things cleaner and easier to develop. The focus on the XML config model has been reduced with the Synapse system being run on an object model config which can be filled using the XML config language or directly (or from a database or whatever We're now working towards an M2 release ASAP to get wider feedback on the core design and architecture and if that goes well another release by ApacheCon to get closer to the desired function for the system.Community development is also making slow but steady progress. The diversity has improved and we've recently added a new committer as well. If all goes well and if the community development continues, Synapse should be ready for graduation soon - probably before ApacheCon.
