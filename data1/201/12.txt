IPMC reviews: jukka (mentorRiver is aimed at the development and advancement of the Jini technology core infrastructure. Jini technology is a service oriented architecture that defines a programming model which both exploits and extends Java technology to enable the construction of secure, distributed systems which are adaptive to change.Positive news is that work on the first release has completed and was approved for release by Incubator, we decided on a branching policy and work on the next release has been scheduled and has started.As a concern though overall participation by the initial set of committers is low, the same applies to people outside the group of committers.Incubating since: December 2006.
