OpenNLP is a machine learning based toolkit for the processing of natural language text. It supports the most common NLP tasks, such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference resolution. These tasks are usually required to build more advanced text processing services.OpenNLP entered incubation on 11/23 2010.We just did our first Apache release on 2nd of May and are now planning which features/work will go into the next release. For instance we started to discuss/plan a big refactoring of our machine learning code, custom feature generation for the name finder, dictionary support for the name finder, etc. .There is still good traffic on both the user and dev mailing list. A couple of users asked questions about how OpenNLP can be trained for new languages.A list of the the most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. Resolve potential IP issues around releasing training models. Establish open regression tests for the parser and coreference component.Signed off by mentor: Grant Ingersoll.
