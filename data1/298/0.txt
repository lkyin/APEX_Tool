Given that it has been less then a month since project entered. incubation I see that the most immediate needs of having a source code. repo, JIRA and MLs have been met. Still it would be nice if the. bootstrapping were to wrap up as quickly as possible. At this point, for. example, there's no website and no wiki, etc. Those are the tools for. helping the community growth and it would be very nice to see those. coming online in a few weeks.
