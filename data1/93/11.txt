Apache DeviceMap is a data repository containing device information, images and other relevant information for all sorts of mobile devices, e.g. smartphones and tablets. While the focus is initially on that data, APIs will also be created to use and manage it.DeviceMap has been incubating since 2012-01-03.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Integrate and release the OpenDDR code and data donations. 2. Integrate additional data sources for device identification. 3. Grow the community.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.No issues.How has the community developed since the last report?.Still very low activity, but signs of improvements with some proposals for concrete.work, that need to be turned into code.How has the project developed since the last report?.No notable progress in terms of code, some community activity but minimal for now.Some proposals have been made around creating services for device identification.and using various (noSQL and other) backends for device data.Please check this when you have filled in the report for DeviceMap.Signed-off-by:.Bertrand Delacretaz: (devicemapKevan Miller: (devicemapAndrew Savory: (devicemap.Shepherd notes:. Third consecutive quarter with low activity. There's some improvement. over the previous quarter, as mentioned in the report, but turning that. into sustainable community activity may take some effort (or luck Is. there anything the broader Incubator community could do to help? .
