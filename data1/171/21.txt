Apache Nuvem will define an open application programming interface for.common cloud application services, allowing applications to be easily.ported across the most popular cloud platforms.Nuvem was accepted for Incubation on June, 2010.Nuvem is a small community, where the contributions are 100% done by.volunteers in their own free time, which makes the level of activity.low, compared to what is required for graduating it as a TLP.We have discussed this matter in the Apache Nuvem PMC, and based on.the PMC synergies and technologies dependencies, we are in conversation.with the Apache Tuscany PMC and plans are to graduate Apache Nuvem as a.subproject of Tuscany. So far, the discussions are going fine, and we.should start required votes soon.Planned activities for graduation:. - Start required votes to graduate as a subproject of Apache Tuscany.Signed-off-by: lresende (mentor), Roman Shaposhnik (rvsIPMC comments:. project has a low level of activity and is self-aware of that, a good. graduation trajectory here seems to be to join Apache Tuscany as a. sub-project. There is a vote in progress addressing such proposal.
