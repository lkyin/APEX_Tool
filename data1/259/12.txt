BlueSky has been incubating since 01-12-2008 It is an e-learning solution designed to help solve the disparity in availability of qualified education between well-developed cities and poorer regions of China.Things are getting better in the last month. First, some critical legal issues which bothers us long time like FFmpeg are solved. Also, we deleted 1394dv support for legal problem, but we believe that would not affect the functionalities. Currently, the only legal issue is ARTS/OSS, and we've already replaced ARTS with SDL, however, it needs sometime to make the whole system run successfully. And we would use ALSA compiled in LGPL way to replace OSS. There are some other good news too. More developers are joining the mailing list and a core team, i believe, is gradually establishing in XJTU. We now aims to the first release and next step we will try to attract more developers on bulletin board system at XJTU to contribute to the future version of RealClass. Plus, MERSMP team, which is incharge of the developing of MERSMP system, now join the dev-mailing list. Together with MERSMP team, we believe that we could make much more achievement in the future. And we still need the committer account so that we commit recent changes of website„ÄÅcode etc. Hope the accounts could be proved soon. the inactive committer account:.1.okid a.k.a Dong Yang.2.stellagjj a.k.a JingJing Gao.3.zhangfan a.k.a Fan Zhang and the new committers would be:.1.mabowen a.k.a Samuel Kevin.2.chenping a.k.a Arthur Chen.top 2 or 3 to resolve prior to first release:.Replace ARTS with SDL and make the system work;.Complete the infomation about BlueSky on wiki and official website;.As to MERSMP team, they need sometime to get used to the Apache way;.Signed off by:.
