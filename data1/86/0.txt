No.Community:. We are still wrapping up getting a few ICLAs for Guergana Savova and for. Sean Finan. So far, little mailing list discussion, but the project is. getting bootstrapped. The next step will be to start developing on list. and getting the project going. Jörn Kottmann who originally volunteered to Champion the project, was. elected to the IPMC and can now officially be our Champion. Congrats Jörn!. The light discussion on the mailing list is because there will be another. release on the old sourceforge site before the migration to the apache svn. and name space updates.Development:. So far, nothing much other than getting mailing lists set up, and other. infrastructure tasks that can be tracked at:. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-4910.Signed off by mentor: mattmann.
