Droids is an Incubator project arrived from Apache Labs Droids entered incubation on October, 2009.It's an intelligent standalone robot framework that allows one to create and extend existing web robots.Things are charging along in Droids. We have a new committer "Mingfai Ma" with new ideas and another real life usecase. He committed some ideas to the sandbox which are going steady into the core distribution. More people are subscribed lately to the mailing list and we received some patches from different new developers. The patches had been incooperated in our repository already.Still the focus is on evolving the design and building a larger community.Signed off by: rgardler.
