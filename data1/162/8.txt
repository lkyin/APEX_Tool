Apache Mnemonic is an advanced hybrid memory storage oriented library,.we've proposed a non-volatile/durable Java object model and durable.computing service that bring several advantages to significantly improve.the performance of massive real-time data.processing/analytics. developers are able to use this library to design.their cache-less, SerDe-less and native-direct computing high.performance applications.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Apache releases: we have release version 0.3.0-incubating. 2. Improved dev. docker to facilitate development. 3. provided information to potential customers e.g. bank user, other. project's Apache committers.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. No.How has the community developed since the last report?. Our last report was in April. Since then. Two more developers are going to join our community. We need to encourage more discussion on the dev list in the coming months.How has the project developed since the last report?. Added durable native sorting service (n-dim linked data) with. testcases. Removed the 3rd Maven repository and use Maven central repository. only. DOM and DNCS could apply to volatile memory service except fixed k-v. store. Added a bench workload to verify the benefits from DNCS with. scripts, generator. Added a sys-vmem service that makes it possible to utilize system. memory for DNCS in an unified way. Added a script to bundle signed portable artifacts for maven. repository submitting. and other bugfixes, features, improvements.Date of last release:. 2016-10-21.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?. None.Signed-off-by:. (mnemonic) Patrick Hunt. (mnemonic) Andrew Purtell. (mnemonic) James Taylor. (mnemonic) Henry Saputra.
