Etch was accepted into Incubator on the 2 September 2008.Etch is a cross-platform, language- and transport-independent framework for building and consuming network services. The Etch toolset includes a network service description language, a compiler, and binding libraries for a variety of programming languages.Progress has been slow this last month, mainly due to lag in getting the source code into Subversion. We have at least now gotten the stuff into /repos/test and everything looks good and are now waiting for Joe to put it into /repos/asf/incubator/etch.The following tasks are in progress:.Publishing source tree in SVN; INFRA has the subversion repo-dumpfile and we have tested access.Confluence Wiki for Etch, and once it is setup we will begin migration of the public pages at http://developer.cisco.com/web/cuae/etch to Apache.Our goal is to get back to coding once we have the infrastructure established.
