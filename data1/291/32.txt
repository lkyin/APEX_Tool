PhotArk started as a project with no initial code-base, and we have grown the community to the minimal 3 independent committer size required for graduation and have been seeing slow but continuous interest in the project. The community started discussion graduation and based on mentors feedback we are going to recruit couple committers before we start the graduation process.Signed off by mentor: lresende.
