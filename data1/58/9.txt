Anything To Triples (any23) is a library, a web service and a command line.tool that extracts structured data in RDF format from a variety of Web.documents.Any23 was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on October 1, 2011.Three most important steps moving towards graduation. - Grow the Any23 PPMC and community. - Ensure at least one Any23 release. - Identify and liase with other semantic web/linked data projects within. the ASF to establish common goals and objectives.The Any23 PPMC was delighted to extend an invitation to Peter Ansell during.June. The invitation was subsequently accepted and we are happy to say that.Peter is now on board.During June/July the community has focused on constructing the 0.7.0-incubating.release candidate. We have experienced several problems along the way which.have delayed this significantly, however as of writing the community is now.VOTE'ing on the 0.7.0-incubating (release candidate #2) release thanks to.Simone Tripodi, we anticipate a release shortly. Since last reporting we have.integrated a number of commits to the project from a range of people. The.total number of commits sitting at >1174 since Any23 entered the Apache.Incubator.The website at http://incubator.apache.org/any23/ is also up and functioning,.and appears to be in line with the Apache branding requirements.Lewis John McGibbney worked with ASF infrastructure to get a zone VM up and.running to host the Any23 web service.The community has again been in touch with members from Stanbol, Jena and.Clerezza and we have already discussed a committer meetup and liason with.the aforementioned sister projects at the forthcoming ApacheCon Europe.Signed off by mentor: mattmann.Shepherd: Dave Fisher.
