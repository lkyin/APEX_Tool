OpenNLP is a machine learning based toolkit for the processing of natural language text. It supports the most common NLP tasks, such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference resolution. These tasks are usually required to build more advanced text processing services.OpenNLP entered incubation on 11/23 2010.We are right now working on getting our first release out, we already created two release candidates and.are busy with testing and bug fixing. The release will hopefully be released in late March or early.April. For the testing we are now using all supported public data sets and distribute the task among.the committers which brings us closer to our third goal to have open regression tests.There is still good activity on our user and dev mailing list. .A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. Resolve potential IP issues around releasing training models. Do a release. Establish open regression tests.Signed off by mentor: Grant Ingersoll.
