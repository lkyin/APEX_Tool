A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation. 1. Move project development to ASF hardware. 2. Grow the community. 3. Get the necessary paperwork (CLAs and software grant) submitted.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?. No issues at this time.How has the community developed since the last report?. We had a BOF at OSCON, which was attended by 8 people, 4 of whom were new to. the community and have expressed interest in participating and have joined the. mailing lists. Other people at OSCON have expressed interest in the project,. and we hope to see them join the lists soon. We have also had some offers of contribution from people at Bitergia who are. interested in contributing the work that they have done around metrics. which. was a very encouraging start to growing the community.How has the project developed since the last report?. This is our first report, as we have just begun the incubation process. Infra has set up our mailing lists, and discussions have started. Also,. since we will be self-hosted, Infra has created a VM for us, and we are. in the process of installing Allura on that VM. We are also in the process. of getting CLAs for all of our initial committers, and reaching out to. anyone outside of the initial team for additional participants on the project.Signed-off-by: gstein, rgardler, jukka.
