Bulusky has been incubating since 01-12-2008 It is an e-learning solution designed to help solve the disparity in availability of qualified education between well-developed cities and poorer regions of China.During the past month, we finally clear the legal problem lay in our source code. Agreement achieved that the libstdc++ don't collide with ASL, however, FFMPEG is absolutely vetoed under ASL. So we have to find a subsitute to replace it.Students of the bluesky team@XJTU are either busy cramming for exams or painstaking coding for an original system. Thus the work at Apache has been greatly delayed. But we still complete several critical things. The first is to eleminate the code which violates ASL from the Bluesky source code. Secondly, we renewed the user manual. Hope it will facilitate people who wanna try our software.Top priorities:.upload our source code to SVN repository. In order to ensure the qualification of our source code under ASL, we will, soon, put our "cleansing version" code on our website at XJTU China and hope people at Apache community to have a double examination. After that we will commit our code to SVN.Another emergency is to replace FFMPEG. FFMPEG plays a critical role in our software. If proper subsititute can't be found, the progress of our incubating at Apache will be delayed to a large extent.
