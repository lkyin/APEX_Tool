Apache PhotArk will be a complete open source photo gallery application including a content repository for the images, a display piece, an access control layer, and upload capabilities.PhotArk was accepted for Incubation on August 19, 2008. Subash Chaturanga completed the "Face Recognition" project as part of GSoC 2011. Umashanthi Pavalanathan completed making Photark more "Social" as part of GSoC 2011. After GSoC, we saw a slightly slowdown in community iterations. . Issues before graduation :. PhotArk started as a project with no initial code-base, and we have grown the community to the minimal independent committer size required for graduation and have been seeing slow but continuous interest in the project. The community started discussion graduation and based on mentors feedback we are going to recruit couple committers before we start the graduation process.Signed off by mentor: lresende.
