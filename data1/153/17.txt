LuceneNet continues to progressing. Recently Lucene.Net 1.9 RC1 build 4 Beta was released and it's on its way to become "final" by the end of the month. Folks are beginning to discover Lucene.Net and activities on the project from posting questions and code fixes are beginning to show some signs of life however, things are still slow in terms of participation. Lucene.Net can use some publicity and exposure which I intend to start doing.
