iPMC Reviewers: robertburrelldonkin, mvdbTripleSoup is the simplest thing that you can do to turn your apache web server into a SPARQL endpoint.Nothing to report that requires IPMC or board attention at this time.There has been very little progress on TripleSoup since the last report. All immediately relevant process/infrastructure/legal stuff has been taken care of, and now we have to dive into the technical core, which hasn't happened yet.
