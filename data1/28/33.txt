PageSpeed represents a series of open source technologies to help make the web faster by rewriting web pages to reduce latency and bandwidth.PageSpeed has been incubating since 2017-09-30.Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:.Grow the number of active developers.Enhance the release process: switch to github tagged release to simplify.Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?.How has the community developed since the last report?.Mailing lists and git issues are active. The number of active developers is unchanged.How has the project developed since the last report?.The first incubator release has been announced after field-testing. Furthermore, small enhancements are being contributed from people outside of the initial committer group. Major changes have landed on master: the build system has been refreshed to leverage bazel, c++17, abseil and Envoy. All dependencies have been refreshed and sanitized where possible. As a side-effect, some of the remaining issues from the WIP-DISCLAIMER have been addressed.MPL licensed source code for http date parsing replaced with our own version which leans on abseil. That part is all Apache licensed now.The no longer contains compiled code pulled in from dependencies.A simple PoC port to Envoy has landed, as a first step towards running PageSpeed as a stand-alone sidecar service (where traffic of arbitrary servers can be routed through it via transparent proxying or L7 routing.How would you assess the podling's maturity?. Community building.Date of last release:.The week of May 11th, 2020.When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?.May 27 2019 (Longinos Ferrando, elected as both committer and PMC member.Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?.Are things falling through the cracks? If so, please list any open issues that need to be addressed.Yes.Is the PPMC managing the podling's brand / trademarks?.Are 3rd parties respecting and correctly using the podlings name and brand? If not what actions has the PPMC taken to correct this? Has the VP, Brand approved the project name?.As far as we know the brand is respected by third parties. We-Amp mirrors the incubator site over at modpagespeed.com - but will work on transferring the domain name to the ASF this quarter.It's not known if the VP, brand has explicitly approved, so that is something we need to make sure about and resolve.Signed-off-by:.
