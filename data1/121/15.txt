Harmony is going well, so well that it is not easy to sum up all the things happening There is, however, currently nothing requiring board or incubator PMC attention. Highlights for the last quarter:.no releases.We have welcomed one new PPMC member:.Tim Ellison.we have welcomed three new committers:.Mikhail Loenko.George Harley.Stepan Mishura and expect to add quite a few more in the next quarter.we have received and processed several more bulk contributions from.different parties, including for beans, regex, math, jndi, logging, prefs,.sql, math(again), crypto, and rmi (twice), hundreds upon hundreds of unit.tests, an eclipse plugin for doing harmony development, and more. Our.framework for accepting these contributions (based on jira, svn, and faxes.and documented on the harmony website) seems to be working well.there was concern over a potential copyright infringement within our JCHEVM.component. This concern has been addressed by receiving a code donation for.the potentially infringing files, without having to resort to lawyers and to.the mutual satisfaction of all parties and under the watchful eye of the.Incubator PMC.we have begun collaborating with the SableVM community, which has relicensed.its VM under the ALv2 (the related previous potential licensing/copyright.issues have been resolved without having to resort to lawyers and to the.mutual satisfaction of all parties and under the watchful eye of the.Incubator PMC.we have seen a lot of discussion on how to do testing, how to use jira, etc.etc, as more and more developers gear up to contribute to the project. These.kinds of discussions are going well and the collaborative consensus-based.process is emerging.we have identified the (future) need for some serious build and testing.server infrastructure but have not approached the infrastructure team about.this yet. IBM is currently hosting a Maven Continuum server to run the.harmony tests, and sending the results to our mailing lists.
