iPMC Reviewers: jukkaThe Yoko project is a robust and high performance CORBA server which is usable from inside any JVM.Since our last report there have been some changes in mentorship and we have continued to improve the Binding runtime and type support for idltowsdl and wsdltoidl as listed below.1) Items to resolve for graduation.We are also planning to improve the documentation for Yoko, with the goal of providing more in depth information to users of the Yoko project and to assist any future committers in understanding the existing code and functionality.Work on stabilizing the code and get it ready for a 1.0 release which should improve overall quality.2) Community aspects.We have a new mentor on board: Welcome Matt Hoggstrom! and thank Ken Coar for his contributions.Discussion started about the project status and how it may work better and/or graduate into other projects like Geronimo, Harmony, and CXF.Increased activity on user/dev list around the binding components, possibly due to the release of CXF driving some interest in the corba binding components.3) Code aspects.Adding more new type support to the binding runtime.Continual improvement of performance for the runtime binding in terms of marshaling and unmarshaling data.Adding new type support to the IDLToWSDL and WSDLToIDL tools and adding quite a number of new tests.Fixing some issues in the ORB core code.Currently working on preparing Yoko for a 1.0 release.Cleaning up the jira issues for the 1.0 release.iPMC comments:.jukka: The listed items before graduation seem more product than process issues. Note that graduation from the Incubator is not tied to product quality.noel: any plans to work with the Apache Directory Server project vis-a-vis CORBALOC and COSNAMING?
