It provides.functions for common statistics tasks (e.g. quantiles, sampling), PageRank,.stream sessionization, and set and bag operations. DataFu also provides.Hadoop jobs for incremental data processing in MapReduce.DataFu has been incubating since 2014-01-05.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Building an ASF-based community. 2. Release. 3. Decide on the future home of the project.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. None.How has the community developed since the last report?. Will Vaughan gave a talk on DataFu at ApacheCon in April, and. Casey Stella gave a talk on Pig and DataFu at the Hadoop Summit in. June.How has the project developed since the last report?. Lots of JIRAs on bug fixes and new features, especially in April and May. Work slowed significantly in June, which probably means it's time for a. release to mark our progress thus far.Date of last release:. None. Six month of incubation.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?. 2014-02-22.Signed-off-by:. (datafu) Ashutosh Chauhan. (datafu) Roman Shaposhnik.
