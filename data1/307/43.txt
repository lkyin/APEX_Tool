[ate, reporting on behalf of Apache Portals PMC as our Chair David Taylor is current on holiday].The WSRP4J Project is an implementation of WSRP 1.0 Producer. WSRP is an OASIS specification that describes a protocol which allows portlets to be accessed remotely using Web Services.The WSRP4J Project has been adopted by the Portals PMC, while still in the Apache Incubator, since August 2003 , with the intent to eventually graduate as a sub-project of Apache Portals.Activity:.There is no activity to report since the last report of June 2009.Primary task, and foremost reason for the incubation stagnation, is resolving the legal IPR issue with regards to the WSRP spec patent claim from WebCollage, see for further detail the report from June 2009.Interest to resolve this issue remains high by the Portals project however, but we lack the legal knowledge and experience how to proceed.The Portals PMC would very much appreciate further help and legal advise in this.The current mentors haven't been interactive in a very long time, maybe other/new mentors might be interested to step up?.Signed off by:.
