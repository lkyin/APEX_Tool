TinkerPop is a graph computing framework written in Java.TinkerPop has been incubating since 2015-01-16.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Add more members to the PMC. 2. Add more members to the committer list. 3. N/A (unless the mentors have ideas?.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. No. Recently, we have really appreciated Daniel Gruno's (mentor) efforts. to get our development community more connected by setting up an Apache. HipChat account for us and interacting with us in a more real-time fashion. on various procedures/policies of Apache in a proactive manner. This has. helped to explain to us (through doing) what is required of Apache.How has the community developed since the last report?. We have 2 new committers: Jason Plurad and Matthew Frantz. We are in the. process of [DISCUSS] about two other potential committers.How has the project developed since the last report?. We have since instantiated a 'review-then-commit' model. Daniel Gruno. (mentor) worked with us to set the appropriate policy documentation and. thus far, it has been going very well. In terms of the adoption of TinkerPop, note that Amazon recently announced. that they use Apache TinkerPop for their order fulfillment network (1. trillion edges This is very public discussion of our technology (videos. + blog posts) should help to attract development talent. We have compiled a list of the other Apache technologies that TinkerPop. works with: Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase, Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark,. Apache Giraph, Apache Atlas, and Apache Falcon. We bring this up to. identify the integration of Apache TinkerPop into the greater Apache. ecosystem. The following articles/presentations/blogposts were provided about.

Please see out Project Status page as we have been diligent to update it. accordingly. http://incubator.apache.org/projects/tinkerpop.html.Signed-off-by:. (tinkerpop) Rich Bowen. (tinkerpop) Daniel Gruno. (tinkerpop) Hadrian Zbarcea. (tinkerpop) Matt Franklin. (tinkerpop) David Nalley.Shepherd/Mentor notes:. Daniel Gruno (humbedooh):. . I will note that despite HipChat and other direct message platforms. involved, the async messages, especially revolving around larger. community/project issues have been on the rise over the past 3 months,. up 71% compared with the 3 months before that, as evident from. http://s.apache.org/Atz> (this is discounting git and jira messages I. see this as a positive signal that the podling is working towards a more. open and inclusive discussion pattern. New committers are being. on-boarded, and I hope to see more PPMC members join the ranks soon. .
