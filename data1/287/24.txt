NPanday allows projects using the .NET framework to be built with Apache Maven.NPanday has been incubating since 2010-08-13.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. work out a concrete plan towards graduation ASAP. 2. encourage newer contributors to do so on a continuing basis. 3. reach out to other projects using .NET that might be interested in working with NPanday.We are still short on mentors, and would appreciate any volunteers.We have had some recent patch submissions again and will encourage those actively using .the project to contribute on a regular basis. We haven't added a new committer since.20 April 2011, so expect to have a low barrier to any new committers.The last release was on 16 May 2011. It is clear that this is impacting the ability of the .project to attract and retain new blood. Unfortunately, there remain some blockers to releasing.the current trunk. We need to push forward with this ASAP.Please check this when you have filled in the report for NPanday.Signed-off-by:.Dennis Lundberg: (npanday.Shepherd notes:.
