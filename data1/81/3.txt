A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation. 1. Licensing work. 2. Finishing up the move of CloudStack infrastructure resources to the ASF. 3. Shipping a release.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?. No issues at this time.How has the community developed since the last report?. CloudStack has added 6 new committers in the month of July. We had BOF and hackathon time at OSCON, which was a positive benefit for. those committers who attended, particularly in being able to delve into. issues around incubation, branding, and licensing. Additionally two. committers presented tutorials at OSCON one focused on end users deploying. CloudStack and the other focused on developers hacking on CloudStack, both. had great attendance. We have also had some offers of contribution from people at Bitergia who are. interested in contributing the work that they have done around metrics. which. was a very encouraging start to growing the community.How has the project developed since the last report?. Lots of modularization has been injected into CloudStack, which makes some. of our licensing issues far less of a problem as we can merely turn the. affected code off by default. The wiki has begun migration to an ASF hosted wiki instance. One of the CloudStack committers provided a dramatically easier way to be. able to test and develop for CloudStack in the form a completely contained. CloudStack environment that can be run as a VirtualBox VM. Much additional. enhancement has been contributed to this making the process easier and. easier to update. We also saw the movement of documentation from binary .docx files to. DocBook XML; while this effort isn't complete it does permit folks to far. more easily collaborate, as well as providing a far better interface. for l10n.Signed-off-by: brett, jukka, jim.
