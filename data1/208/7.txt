ServiceMix has released its second milestone at the end of June Another release is planned for end of August / beginning September. The main plan for the comming months is to release a 3.0 final, by improving test/samples/documentation.The TCK for JBI has been given to committers that have asked for it and have signed the NDA. While we are waiting for a specific mailing list / svn tree to put TCK specific resources, some work has been started.Lots of people seem interesting in contributing to ServiceMix and/or becoming commiters, so there is a good chance that the developer community will grew in the following months. We are in the process of accepting several code contributions: an Eclipse plugin for ServiceMix which would complete the tooling based on Maven 2, and some new JBI components.
