Hama has been incubating since 19 May, 2008 It is a parallel matrix computational package based on Hadoop Map/Reduce.Recent developments:.We implemented BSP(Bulk Synchronous Parallel) library on top of the Hadoop.We were re-architecting the computing engine based on BSP to solve a problem of performance and locality of sub-blocks in distributed system.Required before graduation:.Recently, the community and patch contribution is increasing. However, we need more committer/reviewers who are capable of proofing algorithm.We need more documentation (We are preparing to submit a paper to the USENIX) and education about linear algebra and graph algorithm.Signed off by mentor: brett.
