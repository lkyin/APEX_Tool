(mrql) Alan Cabrera. (mrql) Anthony Elder. (mrql) Alex Karasulu. (mrql) Mohammad Nour El-Din.Shepherd notes:. Dave Fisher (wave):. . This podling achieved one benchmark towards successful incubation - a. release. When commits and mailing list activity are reviewed this looks like a. tiny community with only a single developer and some administrative. support. I am not sure if this another example of a community that is mostly from. a single corporation and is doing all of the work outside and. contributing it through one person with off-list decision making and. communication. If so then the mentors need to look into it and get the. real decision making process in public. There is a user ML, but the only email ever on that list was the release. announcement.
