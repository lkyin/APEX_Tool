None.How has the community developed since the last report?. 1. Since we don't have all of our infrastructure setup yet we haven't made much progress on this front. 2. Have received a number of inquiries about participation in spite of this.How has the project developed since the last report?. 1. Have some of our infrastructure, such as mailing lists, setup. 2. Created PODLINGNAMESEARCH-25 to determine if Knox is a viable project name. 3. Auditing and cleaning up the existing code base in preparation for SVN import. 4. Working on website but that requires completing code grant.Please check this when you have filled in the report for Knox.Signed-off-by:.Owen Oâ€™Malley: (knoxChris Douglas: (knoxMahadev Konar: (knoxAlan Gates: (knoxDevaraj Das: (knoxChris Mattmann: (knoxTom White: (knox.Shepherd notes:.
