IPMC reviews: jukka.UIMA is a component framework for the analysis of unstructured content such as text, audio and video. UIMA entered incubation on October 3, 2006.Some recent activity:.New Releases: Version 2.2.2 of the base framework and an add-on package of annotators, plus a simple server for serving the results of running UIMA Annotators as a web service.3 other components, the Asynchronous Scale-out support (which uses Apache ActiveMQ), a HotFix for the base 2.2.2, and a new CAS Editor, are currently up for a release vote on general@i.a.o list.New sandbox annotators were added that support OpenCalais, a new web service that does annotations.Information from a UIMA Workshop held at LREC in Marrakesh, Morocco, was added to our website; see http://incubator.apache.org/uima/lrec08.html.One user got UIMA to run on the Apache Hadoop infrastructure, and posted a how-to guide on the UIMA Wiki.3 new parts are being incorporated into the Sandbox with software grants: A Common Feature Extractor useful for extracting features from CASes to use as training data in machine learning algorithms, a Concept Mapper - a general dictionary style lookup annotator which may be eventually combined with another dictionary annotator, and a Cas Viewer Eclipse plug-in tool, which may be combined with the Cas Editor work.Items to complete before graduation:.We still need to attract more new committers.Community:.We continue to do outreach to attract new contributors, which may become committers. We hope that the release of the Annotator Package and the upcoming release of UIMA-AS will help.IPMC comments:.jukka: Still attracting new committers? Looking at the Jira contribution reports of the past few releases I see quite a few contributors who've submitted issues and patches. To me it looks like you've already attracted a number of people and just need to vote them in as committers.
