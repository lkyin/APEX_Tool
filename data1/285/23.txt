Increase the number of active committers. 2. Increase adoption, expand user community, and increase user list. activity.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. none.How has the community developed since the last report?. There were no new developers or new committers since our last report. We. are scheduled to present our project at ApacheCon North America in April. We hope that this presentation will attract new developers and users to. our project and will open new opportunities for collaboration with other. Apache projects.How has the project developed since the last report?. We have released our third release under Apache incubation. We have. introduced a major extension to MRQL, called MRQL streaming, that supports. continuous MRQL queries on streams of data. It currently works on Spark. Streaming but we are planning to add support for Flink Streaming in the. future.Date of last release:. 2015-02-25.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?. 2014-04-17.Signed-off-by:. (mrql) Alan Cabrera. (mrql) Alex Karasulu. (mrql) Mohammad Nour El-Din.Shepherd/Mentor notes:. Drew Farris (drew): . . One active mentor this month. There was some delay in obtaining. sufficient PPMC/IPMC votes on this month's release. The project. currently appears to have a single active developer, however I concur. with the comments on potential community growth as indicated in the. report. It looks like things are headed in the appropriate direction to. attract new users and developers. Congratulations on the release.
