The Synapse project is progressing well We have met the target functionality for an M1 release, have voted on it and hope to release it during January. We have had a number of votes and hold a regularly scheduled IRC chat that is well attended by a core team of contributors. The M1 release offers a useful set of functionality, has a codebase that is 100% new code developed by the community under the CLA and ASL2. The release offers users the ability to route, transform and log web service messages passing thru the Synapse intermediary. It utilises a number of existing Apache projects including Axis2.There is a simple Wiki based website for Synapse documentation. We are improving the junit test coverage and javadoc in an ongoing basis.The community is diverse but most of the code has come from members of two companies. There is however active participation from a few other companies on the mailing list and in the IRC chats. We expect to nurture that more and expect to see increased participation as awareness grows with the upcoming M1 release.The project aims to join as a sub-project of the Web Services project and attracts participation from committers of Axis2 in particulare. We are tracking our progress here.
