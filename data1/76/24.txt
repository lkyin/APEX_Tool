Celix is an OSGi like implementation in C with a distinct focus on interoperability between Java and C.Celix has been incubating since 2010-11-02.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Grow a community. 2. Find more committers. 3. .Celix is maintained by 2 committers and a small group of users. Questions to the mailing list are (most of the time) answered quickly. We are also trying to give talks on Celix or related stuff on conferences.We see and recognise the problem of the small community, but are also confident that Celix and its community will grow. Especially the Native-OSGi work might be important for this (see below.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.None.How has the community developed since the last report?.There is no active growth, but in the past few months talks have been given on Native-OSGi. Native-OSGi is an effort to standardise C/C++ implementations of OSGi. The goal of this is to be able to reuse bundles from other OSGi like implementations. Also working together might attract more users/committers. The talks are attended by a good group of people, and reactions are positive.How has the project developed since the last report?.A first release has been made. After struggling with several problems, consensus has been reached to solve these in a next release.On a technical note, Celix now also compiles and runs on Win32 platforms.Please check this when you have filled in the report for Celix.Signed-off-by: .Marcel Offermans: (celixKarl Pauls: (celixRoman Shaposhnik: (celix.Shepherd notes:.Dave Fisher: Celi has a release. It looks like they have a good, but small community.Roman is a new Mentor which Celix needed. I think that they need to identify a couple.more committers and they can push for graduation. I think that they are on the verge.and hope to see graduation sometime in 2013.
