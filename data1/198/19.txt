RAT has been reasonably quiet though the summer of code project has been very active over at Google Initial enthusiasm for developing crawling capabilities was stalled by the lack of quick progress towards a release by Driods.Progress on graduation is still stalled by the lack of a suitable TLP to home the project. RAT illustrates well the inability of the incubator system to work for existing small but open projects without a nominating TLP. If Apache wants to accept more projects of this nature, some process rethinking is needed.Signed off by:.
