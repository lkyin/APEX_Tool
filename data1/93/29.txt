Apache DeviceMap is a data repository containing device information, images.and other relevant information for all sorts of mobile devices, e.g.smartphones and tablets. While the focus is initially on that data, APIs.will also be created to use and manage it.DeviceMap has been incubating since 2012-01-03.The report was not delivered on time from the project itself, as a mentor.I (bdelacretaz) have sent the following challenges to the project's dev list.to try and get the current somewhat active PPMC members to take over:. 1. Challenge #1: provide regular reports. 2. Challenge #2: make a release. 3. Challenge #3: form a PMC with 4-5 members to graduate.Those should really not be challenges but at this point that felt like an.appropriate way of indicating the importance of those actions. There's.already promising responses, we'll see if those translate into concrete.actions.Apart from that there's been some good discussions in the last weeks, but no.concrete results yet.Best is probably to evaluate the progress on the above challenges next month.to make a decision about the future of the project.Date of last release:. No releases yet.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?. May 2013.Signed-off-by:. (devicemap) Bertrand Delacretaz. (devicemap) Kevan Miller. (devicemap) Andrew Savory.Shepherd/Mentor notes:.(rvs) The report is missing. This on-n-off seems to continue with the.project. I know that some of the mentors are recommending giving it more.time, but it seems like we need to establish some metrics to at least get.the community in shape to do the basics (like reporting and releasing.Without any kind of forcing function I am not sure what the future for this.project really is.(bdelacretaz) Agreed - I have now provided a mentor report above.
