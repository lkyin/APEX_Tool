(odftoolkit) Nick Burch. (odftoolkit) Yegor Kozlov.Shepherd/Mentor notes:. Nick Burch (nick):. It's a shame that the large amount of private work done can't be. contributed back to the project, as that could've been a big help. We. are seeing activity again, and the work towards a release which could. help grow interest. More committers are needed, but no strong. candidates are currently visible, so outreach work is needed. Despite. these issues, the project certainly deserves another 3 months to see if. they can turn the corner.
