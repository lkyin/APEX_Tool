Code from both BPE and PXE has been checked into the project's subversion repository with appropriate headers, and the group is prototyping and discussing approaches for integrating the engine with an external runtime (eg., a "plain old JVM", a J2EE application server, or a JBI container) and for deployment.PXE developers are also documenting the codebase (and especially the engine core) to get all contributors to the same level of understanding.
