Logging for C++.log4cxx2 has been incubating since 2013-12-09.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Create a release.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. No.How has the community developed since the last report?. Not grown. However, the project aims to become a sub project of Apache. Logging again. Community growth is not much a matter for this podling, as. long as there are a few active contributors.How has the project developed since the last report?. Not much: There currently doesn't seem to be any public development, though. support is given and bugs are tracked.Date of last release:. 2008-04-03 was the last official, pre-incubation 0.10.0.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?.Signed-off-by:. (log4cxx2) Christian Grobmeier. (log4cxx2) Scott Deboy.Shepherd/Mentor notes:. P. Taylor Goetz (ptgoetz):. It appears the attempt to reboot the lo4cxx2 project by re-incubating is. failing, and the podling is not making any progress in terms of releases. and community development. The primary stated goal of the last few reports has been to produce a. release, but the dev@ mailing list is largely devoid of any release. discussions (the last mention of a release was 12 Dec 2014 [1] The. current report is a word-for-word copy of the last report, and there has. been only one email from a mentor in the last 5 months (to discuss the. incubator report. I noticed that the podling does not appear to have (that I could find) a. private mailing list (possibly an oversight from when it returned to the. incubator?), which I think it would need for discussing new committers/PPMC. members, retiring, etc. I'm assuming they are relying on private@logging. for private discussions, which may not be appropriate for a podling.
