iPMC Reviewers: jukka, jimNMaven develops plugins and integration for Maven to make building and using .NET languages a first-class citizen in Maven.Incubating since: 2006-11-17.Items to resolve before graduation.More active committer involvement. This involves getting a group of developers familiar with the NMaven internals (both .NET and Java), as well as growing a larger community of developers who are creating Maven plugins in .NET.Engage other ASF projects (Lucene.NET, log4net) to see if NMaven can meet any of their needs.Need a fair amount of work in getting the features in place so that we can automate releases of the .NET assemblies and projects. Getting on a regular schedule of releases, should help grow the community.Status:.Active involvement from the community has been a little slow; but has picked up recently, as seen by the recent increase of discussions on the mailing list and community interest in submitting patches for features.Published 6-month Road Map on Wiki.The latest features of writing Maven plugins directly in .NET and of IDE integration between Maven and Visual Studio are both targeted directly toward .NET developers. These features are expected to increase developer interest from the .NET community, particularly among those who may not have had previous experience with Java or Maven.Fast feather talk on NMaven at ApacheCon in effort to increase community interest in project.Plans:.Work on getting the site documentation up-to-date with the latest features.Work on improving IDE features.Preparing for a release.
