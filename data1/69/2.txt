Bloodhound is an issue tracker derivative of Trac, with the goal of making.deployment easy, and usage intuitive.Bloodhound has been incubating since December 2011.The current three most important issues toward graduation remain unchanged.from last month, and are:. 1. Improving community diversity. 2. Lowering the barrier to entry and development. 3. Creating shippable releases and getting user feedback.The last month saw the addition of one committer, Joachim Dreimann, as well.as increased technical discussion on the mailing lists, particularly around.the areas of user interface, multi-project support and rudimentary.installation capabilities. In addition, the first commits of code that.should form part of the distribution have been achieved, providing the.basis for multi-project support and a very basic installer script.The primary goals of the community remain getting something potential.developers can play with into the repository, and creating a release to.get some widespread exposure to the project.Signed off by mentor: hwright, gstein.
