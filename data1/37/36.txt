(singa) Alan Gates Comments: I don't see finishing the existing JIRA. tickets as the key to graduation. This podling has added new committers. and done releases, but they continue to move at a very slow pace. I am. concerned about them having enough engagement to have 3 PMC members. available to vote. Seeing more consistent engagement is to me the criteria. for graduation. (singa) Ted Dunning Comments:. (singa) Thejas Nair Comments:.
