iPMC Reviewers: jimTika is a toolkit for detecting and extracting metadata and structured text content from various documents using existing parser libraries.Incubating since: March 22nd, 2007.Community.We had a good project bootstrap meeting as a part of the text analysis BOF at the ApacheCon EU in Amsterdam. The resulting ideas were summarized on the project mailing list, and the first design threads have started.Development.We've started discussing the design of the Tika toolkit. It seems like we will select one of the existing codebases listed in the project proposal as the basis of an early 0.1 release, and start refactoring the code into a more generic toolkit. The Tika svn tree is still empty, but I expect us to see the first code commits before the next report.Infrastructure.All the initial infrastructure is now in place. There is still some activity on the temporary Tika wiki on the Google Project hosting service, so we may end up requesting a Tika wiki to be set up on the ASF infrastructure.Issues before graduation.The Tika project is still at an early stage of incubation. The most important tasks before graduation are to develop and release the Tika codebase and to grow a diverse and sustainable project community.
