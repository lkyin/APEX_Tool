Apache Beam is an open source, unified model and set of language-specific.SDKs for defining and executing data processing workflows, and also data.ingestion and integration flows, supporting Enterprise Integration Patterns.(EIPs) and Domain Specific Languages (DSLs Beam pipelines simplify the.mechanics of large-scale batch and streaming data processing and can run on.a number of runtimes such as Apache Flink, Apache Gearpump, Apache Apex,.Apache Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow. Beam also brings SDKs in different.languages, allowing users to easily implement their data integration.processes.Beam has been incubating since 2016-02-01.The most important issue to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Make it easier for the Beam community to to learn, use, and grow by.expanding and improving the Beam documentation, code samples, and the.website.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware.of?.None.How has the community developed since the last report?. 441 closed/merged pull requests. High engagement on dev and user mailing lists (742 / 179 messages Several public talks, articles, and videos including:. - @Scale San Jose (“No shard left behind: APIs for massive parallel.efficiency in Apache Beam” - Strata + Hadoop World NYC (“Learn stream processing with Apache Beam” - Paris Spark Meetup (“Introduction to Apache Beam” - Hadoop Summit Melbourne (“Stream/Batch processing portable across.on-prem (Spark, Flink) and Cloud with Apache Beam” - Hadoop User Group Taipei (“Stream Processing with Beam and Google.Cloud Dataflow” - Data Science Lab London (“Apache Beam: Stream and Batch Processing;.Unified and Portable!”.How has the project developed since the last report?.Major developments on the project since last report include the following:. Second and third incubating release (0.2.0 and 0.3.0) and a release guide.[1]. New DirectRunner support for testing streaming pipelines[2]. Continued improvements to the Flink, Spark, and Dataflow runners. Added support for new IO connectors, including MongoDB, Kinesis, and JDBC.with Cassandra, MQTT support pending in pull requests. Addition of the Apache Apex runner on a feature branch, and continued.work on the Apache Gearpump runner and Python SDK feature branches. [3]. Continued reorganization and refactoring of the project.
