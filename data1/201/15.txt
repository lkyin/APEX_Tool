River is aimed at the development and advancement of the Jini technology core infrastructure Jini technology is a service oriented architecture that defines a programming model which both exploits and extends Java technology to enable the construction of secure, distributed systems which are adaptive to change.A substantial amount of issues have been resolved (34 in total) with a small number (18 in total) left for our second release. The overall participation of committers has been improved and we have seen more discussion around issues, although participation of non Sun committers is still not what it ought to be. The need for an automated test environment is felt and the workflow for JIRA should be adapted to facilitate our review then commit policy which committers seem to do in practice.Things that needs to be done before graduation:.the API in the com.sun namespace must be changed to org.apache, probably has to await the incorporation of patches lingering around and after our automated test framework is in place.overall participation of non Sun committers must increase and we should grow our community by getting more people involved.Incubating since: December 2006
