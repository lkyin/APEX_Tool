Kitty is a command-line based JMX administration and automation utility.This month was primarily engaged in discussion about the roadmap of the project.After presenting the project to the Los Angeles Java Users Group, the community here expressed that the utility should not only focus on Tomcat, but should have a plugin architecture where application-specific JMX attributes are made available by dropping in plugins in to the application. .Kitty currently doesn't have such a capability, and the kitty-dev list agrees that Kitty should head in this direction. A document will be produced discussing how to best achieve the modular architecture, and begin working on adding these capabilities, beginning with Tomcat 6 and Tomcat 7 plugins.Some small code cleanup was done, and documentation will be produce on how to get started in developing for Kitty to promote further community adoption.Signed off by mentor: kevan.
