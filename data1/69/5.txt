Bloodhound is an issue tracker derivative of Trac, with the goal of making.deployment easy, and usage intuitive.Bloodhound has been incubating since December 2011.The top three issues that need to be addressed to move toward graduation are.still:. 1. Improving community diversity. 2. Lowering the barrier to entry and development. 3. Creating shippable releases and getting user feedback.Over the last three months there has been significant design and development.effort into the project, taking the codebase from being a basic installer to.adding a new interface. The front-end design is considered to be complete at.this stage but more work is required to implement this design. Despite this,.the project remains installable and it has become possible for new developers.to contribute relatively quickly.No new committers have been added over the last three months but we have had.very welcome patches from new contributors. Activity on the developer mailing.list seems to have reduced which is disappointing. This may be remedied in.part by encouraging more discussion that currently takes place in the issue.tracker to take place in the mailing list.The target of creating an initial release is ongoing. With the conversion of.most of the interface to a new basic design, it is only completion of a subset.of the dashboard design that should be seen as a requirement for an initial.release. This remains the immediate primary goal of the community, and should.help community diversity by increasing the exposure of the project.Signed off by mentor: hwright, gstein.Shepherd: Dave Fisher.
