River is aimed at the development and advancement of the Jini technology core infrastructure Jini technology is a service oriented architecture that defines a programming model which both exploits and extends Java technology to enable the construction of secure, distributed systems which are adaptive to change. River has been incubating since December 2006.The River project is not doing well. Practically all original committers are inactive and while there are interested users and even some pretty active discussions about the future of River, that interest isn't showing up as patches or other more constructive contributions.We've seen some effort towards making the QA test suite more accessible, and there is interest in doing another release. However, nobody is actively working on new features or bigger improvements. It has been suggested that River needs a major new vision, but it's debatable whether that would do better as a fresh new project. In any case nobody is actively pushing for anything like that.There is still hope for River, but at this rate the project is heading for termination.Issues before graduation:.Re-activate the development community.Migrate packages to org.apache.river.Another Apache release.
