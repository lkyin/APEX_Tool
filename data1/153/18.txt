LuceneNet continues to progress. Recently Lucene.Net 1.9 RC1 Final was released. In addition, Lucene.Net 1.9.1 Beta is released. Work is underway to release Lucene.Net 2.0 Beta by end of July. Folks are beginning to discover Lucene.Net and activities on the project from posting questions and code fixes are beginning to show some signs of life. However, things are still slow in terms of participation. Lucene.Net can use some publicity and exposure which I intend to start doing by asking to create a link to Lucene.Net on the main Jakarta Lucene web page as well as by creating a Wiki page for Lucene.Net.
