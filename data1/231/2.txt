iPMC Reviewers: robertburrelldonkin, mvdbTika is a toolkit for detecting and extracting metadata and structured text content from various documents using existing parser libraries. Tika entered incubation on March 22nd, 2007.Community.The Tika mailing lists have been relatively quiet lately, probably because with little code we don't yet have many concrete issues to talk about.Development.We saw the first piece of Tika code when Chris A. Mattmann ported the Nutch metadata framework to Tika. Rida Benjelloun has created a version of the Lius codebase to be included in Tika, and the code is currently in the issue tracker.Issues before graduation.The Tika project is still at an early stage of incubation. We need to continue bringing in the initial codebases and probably target for an initial incubating release later this year. We also need to work on growing the community and figuring out how to best interact with external parser projects.iPMC questions / comments:.robertburrelldonkin - tika is at a very early stage of development and incubator.
