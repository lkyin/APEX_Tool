iPMC Reviewers: rdonkin, jukkaDescription: FtpServer is a Java based implementation of the RFC covering different aspects of FTP.Since the last board report, the main activity within FtpServer has been a rather large rewrite to create an Apache MINA based network implementation. The aim with this is to leverage the asynchronous IO library to get better scalability. The initial performance tests shows that this has been successful and that FtpServer now can handle significant loads. Besides this major work, many minor issues has been closed, mostly based on feedback from users.As reported previously, FtpServer has very few active commiters. Currently, there is only one. This is, for many reasons a big problem and one that we need to resolve. A discussion was started on general@i.a.o ton address this. Among many good ideas, one was to seek closer cooperation with Tomcat and write a FTP connector for Tomcat. This is something we will pursue both based on technical (Tomcat is a very stable runtime to base FtpServer on) and community merits. With this, we hope to possibly attract Tomcat developers into the joys of FTP.We also need to reach out using articles, blog posts and talks. No significant progress has been made in this area since the last report.iPMC questions / comments:.jukka: Incubating since 2003-03-29.
