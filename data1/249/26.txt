iPMC Reviewers: jukka, yoavs, jim, noelWoden is a Java class library for reading, validating, manipulating, creating and writing WSDL documents, initially to support WSDL 2.0 and with the longer term aim of supporting past, present and future versions of WSDL.We are trying to track down / re-do the paperwork (Software Grant) for donation of WSDL4J from IBM. WSDL4J is an SF.NET project under CPL 1.0 for the original WSDL 1.1 spec. Some of the code in woden was borrowed by the developers which is natural since woden implements WSDL 2.0 spec.iPMC questions / comments:.jukka: Things to do before graduation?.[DIMS]: A few more committers would always help .yoavs: how long has Woden been incubation? How's the community doing: any new committers, contributors, or PPMC members? When's a release going to happen?.[DIMS] Please remember they are expecting to join WS PMC. So they are already part of the larger eco system and constantly get feedback since we are working on codegen in Axis2 based on WSDL2.0 (supported by woden They will most probably have to cut another milestone for use with Axis2 (soon!)
