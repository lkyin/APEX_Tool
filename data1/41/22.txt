Taverna is a domain-independent suite of tools used to design and execute.data-driven workflows.Taverna has been incubating since 2014-10-20.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Project maturity evaluation and graduation. 2. Complete IP/license review of unreleased repositories. 3. Further engaging user/devops community.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. Preparing to graduate.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. The community is moving towards graduation, by preparing a. Graduation Maturity Assessment. https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TAVERNADEV/2016-03+Taverna+Graduation+Maturity+Assessment. While we wished we could have released all of Taverna's git repositories. through the Incubator before graduating, we realize that with limited. developer time, getting all of them to a cleanly releasable state. could remove focus from development of the core repositories. As we an important point of Incubator releases is to ensure the project. understands the ASF release process, including release review and voting,. IP management and licensing compatibility; as well as accepting. contributions. We believe we have gained that after 3 release votes. https://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/taverna/source/. and 7 GSOC/student contributors. We have however identified the need for a License Review of the remaining. git repositories that have not yet been formally released through the. Apache Incubator (e.g. to ensure ASF file headers), which we are now. completing:. https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TAVERNADEV/2016-09+License+review. We might consider not including all of these repositories as we move. towards graduation - we already have an alternative home. https://github.com/taverna-extras for dormant extensions. dev@taverna mailing lists stats:.

We have seen an upsurge in activity with. two successful GSOC projects as well as several. new plugins from other students. Some of them have shown interest. in continued contributions, which we must take into account. for proposing new committers. This have admittedly taken some focus from the committers. from the incubator graduation path - so we're now. putting effort back into finishing our License Review.Date of last release:. 2016-07-01 taverna-engine-3.1.0-incubating. 2016-07-01 taverna-common-activities-2.1.0-incubating. 2016-07-01 taverna-commandline-3.1.0-incubating.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?. 2015-12-04.Signed-off-by:. (taverna) Andy Seaborne. (taverna) Daniel J Debrunner. (taverna) Suresh Srinivas. (taverna) Suresh Marru. (taverna) Marlon Pierce.Shepherd/Mentor notes:. Andy Seaborne:. The Taverna podling is hindered by a lack of active mentors (myself. included) - the project has appealled to general@ on a couple of. occasions. 3 of the 4 active contributors are from one institution and contribution. is related to EU project commitments. The codebase is large and has a. long history. One option is to identify a "core" and move out the rest. until such time as they are sustainable. More active PMC/commiters. would be a big boost. The comment from the last report applies:. Drew Farris (shepherd):. Little mentor activity on the mailing lists, could use another. active mentor. Healthy activity in the community.
