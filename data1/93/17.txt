Apache DeviceMap is a data repository containing device information, images.and other relevant information for all sorts of mobile devices, e.g.smartphones and tablets. While the focus is initially on that data, APIs will.also be created to use and manage it.DeviceMap has been incubating since 2012-01-03.There are no issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or the ASF Board need to be.aware of.Our last report indicated a need to reboot the podling, this has been.successfully done. .Three new committers and PPMC members have been elected since April, and have.been quite active in expanding and improving the podling's code base. .New Java and C# modules have been added and tests are ongoing to validate and.compare the various implementations.The community stays small but is now regularly active, making a release or two.in the next period should allow DeviceMap to graduate.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Make at least one release . 2. Clarify how/where DeviceMap gets its device data. Not strictly required. to graduate but good for the viability of the project, various options. are being evaluated. 3. Graduate - apart from having made a release the podling seems ready for. that.Date of last release:. none yet.Signed-off-by:. (devicemap) Bertrand Delacretaz. (devicemap) Kevan Miller.
