Droids is an Incubator project arrived from Apache Labs. Droids entered incubation on October, 2008.It's an intelligent standalone robot framework that allows one to create and extend existing web robots.The last three months have been very productive and focused on our first official release. However a discussion on the general incubator list raised concern about the absence of binding votes of IPMC members. This leaded to abort the first release. In the last member meeting we selected one of our Droids committer as member and he subscribed now to the incubator PMC to have a binding vote as well.Issues before graduation :. Do a release. IP clearance.Signed off by mentor: Thorsten Scherler.
