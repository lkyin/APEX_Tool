Rya (pronounced "ree-uh" /rēə/) is a cloud-based RDF triple store that.supports SPARQL queries. Rya is a scalable RDF data management system built.on top of Accumulo. Rya uses novel storage methods, indexing schemes, and.query processing techniques that scale to billions of triples across.multiple nodes. Rya provides fast and easy access to the data through.SPARQL, a conventional query mechanism for RDF data.Rya has been incubating since 2015-09-18.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Populate the website for the project. 2. Expand the "how to" document to explain the ways new contributors can. become involved in the project, so we increase the size of the. community. 3. Become familiar with the release process and have a first release as. part of the Apache Foundation.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?.No.How has the community developed since the last report?. We have documented (on Confluence) and tested procedures for committers. to review and incorporate Pull Requests into the incubator-rya Apache. git repository. The committers are becoming much more comfortable with the Apache. infrastructure and processes. Committers have been documenting processes. on Confluence, creating Jira tickets, tying these to Rya components and. versions, and submitting and pulling in PRs to resolve these Jira. tickets. The Rya user community (i.e. non-committers) have begun submitting. issues through Jira and the dev list. These have become Jira tickets,. resolved by committers, and tested by the community. Specifically, the. community submitted RYA-19, RYA-17, and RYA-6. Committers resolved and. the community tested RYA-19 and RYA-17. Non-committers have also begun submitting PRs that have been. incorporated into the apache repo. Specifically, RYA-13 and most of. RYA-7 was done by non-committers. We've started logging "beginner" Jira tickets. These are issues that. we've found in Rya that a new developer could take on as a good way to. "get their feet wet" in the code base.How has the project developed since the last report?. We've completed adding the Apache license headers and added license. header verification to the project's build. Resolved a handful of issues that users have encountered. Committed features: Delete support for secondary indices, more efficient. Mongo Core and Geo indexing. Still working on creating a website for the project. Working on deploying artifacts onto Maven. Working on creating a quick-start VM for users to try out Rya.Date of last release:. Not applicable.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?. Not applicable.Signed-off-by:.

Continuing to see growing activity, but not much collaboration between. reviews among committers (saw some ignored comments on pull requests. Something to watch in the future.
