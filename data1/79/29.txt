(incubating since November 27th, 2009.Clerezza is a framework and set of components designed to make it easy to.build application for the semantic and the social web.Graduation:. We believe Clerezza will be ready to graduate soon. Currently discussions. for a plan for community development are ongoing. Once a plan for community. development has been defined we can discuss graduation. Documentation and. tutorials are still in need of improvement and this may be addressed as. part of the community development plan but we believe lacking documentation. alone should not stand in the way of graduation.How has the community developed since the last report:. The cooperation with the Apache Stanbol project has been improved with. two Stanbol committers becoming Clerezza committers.How has the project developed since the last report. - We successfully released Clerezza (0.2-incubating. - Apache Wink has accepted a patch by a Clerezza developer. This presents. an opportunity to replace our own JAX-RS implementation with Wink's. - Discussions about the release process and its documentation have taken. place. We have identified possible problems with our version policy and. release process when releasing only a subset of the modules Clerezza. consists of. It is our intention to be able to make such releases. No. conclusion has been reached yet. - A drop of activity in the second half of this quarter (after the release. This can be partially explained with the fact that many developers use. Clerezza in other projects and the release caused a temporary shift in. focus on those projects.Signed off by mentor: bdelacretaz, rgardler.
