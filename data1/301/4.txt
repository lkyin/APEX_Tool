Stonehenge has been incubating since December 2008.Stonehenge a set of example applications for Service Oriented Architecture that spans languages and platforms and demonstrates best practices and interoperability by using currently defined W3C OASIS standard protocols.In the month of March, the growing Stonehenge community has ramped its activity on several fronts, and has made solid plans for near future::.Admin: The donated code from Microsoft and WS02 was moved from contrib to trunk. In the process various installation and configuration issues were identified, and the community has worked very closely on the DL and offline to advance these issues.Community: 3 SUN developers have joined and have been working through the various installation and configuration issues, and understanding the code architecture. They plan to contribute a Metro based java implementation in the medium term. Synergy has been developing between the WS02 and Microsoft developers towards identifying and resolving common issues.Code: The community has had discussions about a first release (M1) in the immediate short term. The release is defined to be executable code from the .NET and PHP implementations of the StockTrader application, along with complete documentation allowing a new Stonehenge member to demonstrate interoperability by mixing and matching components from the two StockTrader applications. The two applications are also undergoing necessary code changes to quality for passing the RAT tool (such as adding the legal headers.Wider Community: Some members and sponsors of Stonehenge have attended ApacheCon EU and connected with the wider community about Stonehenge.
