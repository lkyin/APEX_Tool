Remove incompatible license dependencies and implement over ALV2 compatible libraries. 2. Simplify the build process and provide simple to use cases. 3. At least one Apache Incubator release. 4. Develop a strong community with organizational diversity and well aligned with existing ASF projects as outlined here: http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/AiravataProposal#Alignment.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.No, not at this time.How has the community developed since the last report?.A web designer Barbara Hallock has contributed, Airavata Logo, web site banner and CSS.
