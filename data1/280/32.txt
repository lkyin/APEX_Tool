Kalumet a complete environment manager and deployer including J2EE.environments (application servers, applications, etc), softwares, and.resources.Kalumet has been incubating since 2011-09-20.No report submitted this month.Shepherd/Mentor notes:. Justin Mclean (jmclean):. Podling may be in a little trouble. Failed to report this month, mailing. list traffic and commits at a very low level. A mentor is still active. but looks likes like the last release candidate (October 2013) wasn't. voted on by the IPMC and a new release candidate hasn't been created. Last report talked about graduation so perhaps they just need some help. in getting past the final hurdle?.
