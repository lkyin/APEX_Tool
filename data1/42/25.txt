Comments: Sent following email to dev list after reading this report: . It seems development on Tephra has slowed quite a bit lately, with only 7 . JIRAs filed during the last 3 months. I know Tephra is used in other . projects, like Apache Phoenix. Is this slowdown temporary? Is development . slowing because Tephra is mature and only maintenance is now required? Is . it continuing to be picked up by new projects or only used in 1 or 2 . places? I ask because it feels like it is near time for Tephra to graduate . (it's been incubating for over 2 years now) and what needs to be done to . graduate is somewhat determined by the answers to these questions. (tephra) Andrew Purtell. Comments:.
