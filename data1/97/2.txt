Drill's goal is to build an open source clone of Dremel with appropriate.extensions to foster greater flexibility.Drill has been incubating since September of 2012.Since last month, we have been working on bringing in existing code assets.We now have the following items in our source repository:. - A web-based GUI front-end for DRILL. - A query parser for a Dremel equivalent language. - An early prototype of a physical plan interpreter.The web front-end and query parser still need formalized IP clearance.including ICLA's or CCLA's as appropriate. Informal clearances have been.granted on all components.In terms of infrastructure, the project web site has been incorporated into CMS.Graduation is still very far away, but the community activity has been high.and the mailing list has been active with over 200 postings in October. .Numerous public presentations have been made since the last report.Most important issues to address before we can graduate: . Get the basics in place, build up a working code base, make releases. (that is, everything) .Any issues the Incubator PMC or ASF board need to be aware of: . None at this time .How has the community developed since the last report: . The active contributors mentioned in the previous report continue to. be active and additional contributors have been identified. At least. one corporate supporter of the project has hired a full-time engineer. to focus on Drill. We are working to bind these new contributors into the. community and several appear likely to become committers over time.How has the project developed since the last report: . The community has continued to make progress and substantial code assets. are in the process of being contributed.Signed-off-by: berndf.
