As.detailed in the graduation plan [1] in the previous report we hope to attract.more community members with this move. Details for Native-OSGi can be found.at [2].Also the donation of the Device Access code has been finished and committed.to the SVN repository. This has been a good experience from both a technical.and a process point of view.Furthermore there has been a slight increase on the mailing list, hopefully.this is a trend that will continue in the coming months.Most important issues to address before we can graduate:. Make a first release and grow a larger community. It is also needed to. attract some more committers, there are currently 2.Any issues the Incubator PMC or ASF board not te be aware of:. None at this time.How has the community developed since the last report:. There has been an increase on the mailing list, furthermore with the start. of the Native-OSGi project we hope this will increase in the coming months.How has the project developed since the last report:. From a technical point of view, we are working towards a first release. The build files have been updated to support a more modular project. structure.
