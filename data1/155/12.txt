(madlib) Roman Shaposhnik.Shepherd/Mentor notes:. tdunning:. This project seems to be ticking along pretty reasonably. The only worry I. have about it is that it seems to be strongly centered around a few (or. even just one) very strong contributors. That is a worry relative to. longevity and community building. Overall, I don't think that the project. is getting much marginal value from incubation. johndament:. Its unclear what guidance from the IPMC is required if the podling is. already reaching out to legal, which would be the main thing I can think. of to recommend to them right now. rvs:. @johndament: I think we need to formalize whatever decision by legal. I'll. create a formal LEGAL JIRA soon.
