At the moment the project is discussing its future. So far.almost no community could be grown and it is being discussed.if the project should become a sub-project of Apache Cordova.The pros of this solution would be:. - Cordova is a consumer of Ripple. - Cordova is an active project and has a functional PMC.One con of this solution is that Cordova cannot guarantee.the success of the project. Also, the current Ripple code base.cannot be released, as there are some things to sort out (from.legal perspective, like the images cannot be redistributed.Both communities have discussed this option and also the option.to move to GitHub. So far no agreement could be reached.(Christian Grobmeier.Signed-off-by:. (ripple) Jukka Zitting. (ripple) Christian Grobmeier. (ripple) Andrew Savory.
