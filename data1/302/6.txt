Tashi has been incubating since September 2008.The Tashi project aims to build a software infrastructure for cloud computing on massive internet-scale datasets (what we call Big Data The idea is to build a cluster management system that enables the Big Data that are stored in a cluster/data center to be accessed, shared, manipulated, and computed on by remote users in a convenient, efficient, and safe manner.Development activities have included adding support for using a database to track virtual machine information, modifying code to work with Python 2.4, integration with dynamic DHCP and DNS servers, and adding a "tidy" target to check the source code.There have been a few questions on tashi-user@i.a.o that centered around getting Tashi up and running. Additionally, submissions on the dev list included patches from a student at CMU, and some scripts from a non-committer at Intel. There is still a lot of work to be done in growing a community.Items to be resolved before graduation:.Put more effort into project documentation so that other potential contributors may more easily get involved.Develop community diversity (currently Intel and CMU committersPrepare and review a release candidate.
