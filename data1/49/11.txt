iPMC Reviewers: jukka, jimAbdera is an implementation of the Atom Publishing Protocol and Atom Syndication Format.Incubating since: 2006-06-05.Abdera has continued work on version 0.3.0, and is waiting for the Atom Publication Protocol to be completed by the Atom WG so that we can finalize support for it.Additionally, there was some discussion of the best way to handle vendor specific extensions in Abdera. The consensus seems to be that there was no objection to having them as long as the extension was clearly defined in a public spec that was available under reasonable licensing terms.We continue to see questions from new community members, which indicates that the code is being used, and when possible we've been trying to encourage them to contribute back to the project. Hopefully that will result in some new committers in the reasonably near future.
