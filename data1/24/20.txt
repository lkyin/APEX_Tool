A Flexible and Efficient Library for Deep Learning.MXNet has been incubating since 2017-01-23.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Establish a predictable release process consistent with Apache Way --. ESTABLISHED. 2. Grow the community -- ONGOING. 3. Identify remaining ICLAs or SGAs that need signing NEAR COMPLETION.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?.None.How has the community developed since the last report?.
