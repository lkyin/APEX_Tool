Celix is an implementation of the OSGi Specification in C.Celix entered incubation on November 2, 2010.Over the last few months lots of work has been put into integrating APR and updating the Celix code base to the proposed code style. This code style has partially been documented on [1]. Also some effort has been put into updating the source for Visual Studio, even though not yet finished some interesting and helpful patches where submitted and applied.In Oktober an event was held to create more awareness for services, OSGi and Celix in the Dutch embedded community. The attendance was great, and a follow-up will be planned. Also, in November a talk was given at the ApacheCon.As listed below, one of the most important issues is the slow growth of the Celix community. With the current discussion about poddlings and how long a poddling is in the incubator, we are discussing a plan how we can move to a more diverse community and be able to graduate. This plan will be included in the next board report.Most important issues are:. Improve robustness (APR, error handling etc), resulting in a first release. Generate awareness and grow a community!.Signed off by mentor: marrs.
