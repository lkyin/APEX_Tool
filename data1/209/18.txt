Shindig is a reference implementation of the OpenSocial and gadgets stack The active community has built two parallel implementations of the OpenSocial and gadgets spec; one in Java and one in PHP.Incubating since: 2007-12-06.High-level status summary during last quarter:.stable release compliant to OpenSocial v0.9 currently being reviewed by PMC.updates for OpenSocial v0.9 are implemented and in production on several sites that support OpenSocial.two new committers joined the community. The committer base on the Java side is relatively varied. However, until now we have had a single committer working on the PHP implementation. This changed with the addition of two new committers focussing on PHP. The lack of committer count (and thus diversity) on PHP was a graduation issue. The addition of these two committers certainly moves the project in the right direction regarding graduation.Requirements for graduation:.Discussion about graduation is ongoing. The most pressing need that was identified was to diversify our committer base for PHP. In many other ways, the project and community are in very good shape.Signed off by: Upayavira,.
