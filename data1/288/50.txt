Java modules that allow programmatic creation, scanning and manipulation of.OpenDocument Format (ISO/IEC 26300 == ODF) documents.Shepherd/Mentor notes:. Rob Weir (robweir):. . No report submitted, though I did remind the PPMC. I sense some "report. fatigue" since they missed the July report deadline, submitted then in. time for August, but lacked a mentor sign off, and then submitted again in. September and did get sign off. Drew Farris (drew):. . Kudos to robweir activity as a mentor, however this project could use. another mentor. Generally little traffic or activity. Nick Burch (nick):. Project has recently added a committer, which is good, but otherwise the level. of activity remains too low. I've heard rumours of development happening. in private elsewhere, but unless that effort returns to the project and. activity improves, I think we're going to have to look at admitting defeat. and retiring the podling soon.
