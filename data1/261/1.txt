Start developing at the ASF. 2. Start using ASF JIRA. 3. Get code pushed to ASF Git repo.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. N/A.How has the community developed since the last report?. See below.How has the project developed since the last report?. CMDA has not really gotten started at the ASF yet. Very little has changed. since the last report. The most important thing is getting the community. started. At the moment the CMDA JIRA is completely empty and the code base. has yet to be pushed to the git repo. Mailing list activity is largely. non-existent and there's no website up for the project yet. Hopefully. these hurdles will be crossed during this next month so that more active. develop can start for the project.Date of last release:.
