Gora is an ORM framework for column stores such as Apache HBase and Apache Cassandra with a specific focus on Hadoop.A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation. 1. Port Gora code and license headers into ASF license headers. 2. Develop a strong community with organizational diversity and with infection into existing ASF projects like Nutch and Hadoop. 3. At least one Gora incubating release.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.No, not at this time.How has the community developed since the last report?.In July 2011, we elected Ioannis Cannelos to the Gora PPMC and as a Gora Committer. We've also had a.lot of interest from the Nutch community lately (specifically Lewis John McGibbney) as they are.trying to help us get a stable version of Gora 0.2 trunk out the door and working with Maven Central.so that Nutch as a downstream consumer can leverage Gora in it's 2.0 trunk version.How has the project developed since the last report?.Gora was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on September 26, 2010.We are on RC #4 for Gora 0.1.1-incubating, a small patch to 0.1-incubating to get Maven dependencies.working and a process in place. There has been some recent dev activity in trunk by Alexis Detreglode.to get a new Cassandra back-end store in place, and improve upon the existing one. There are also efforts.underway by Henry Saputra to get a CI build on Jenkins going for Gora.Signed off by mentor: mattmann.
