BlueSky has been incubating since 01-12-2008 It is an e-learning solution designed to help solve the disparity in availability of qualified education between well-developed cities and poorer regions of China.Recent Activity: We finished the required work by Bill, our mentor. We'd tried to use Dirac for replacing FFmpeg, while we were waiting for the results of second code view. However, some problems happened and could be resolved. Reading api of FFmpeg and vobis„ÄÅtheora is still undergoing. The reason, why it is retarded, is that we had to do several projects simultaneously, besides the classes. The running demo of Bluesky is postponed too, but i can assure that it would be completed next week, after i finish the coding task this week.Next step:.Waiting for the second code view results.Recording Bluesky running demo.Tried to work out a reliable sketch of replacing FFmpeg in two weeks.
