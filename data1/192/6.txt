PLC4X is a set of libraries for communicating with industrial programmable .logic controllers (PLCs) using a variety of protocols but with a shared API.PLC4X has been incubating since 2017-12-18.Most important issues to address while moving towards graduation:.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Building the community: The PPMC and committer group has a large .percentage of codecentric employees, we have been recruiting people from .other companies, but will have to continue these efforts for establishing a .healthy Apache community. 2. Onboarding of new committers: With PLC4X several people on the team are .not very familiar with the Apache Way. We have started and will continue our .efforts on this onboarding. 3. Make our first release.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?.Not at the moment.How has the community developed since the last report?.Christofer has invested most of his time in May and June spreading the word .about PLC4X.There have been several conference talks on PLC4X:. Building IoT 2018 in Cologne: Christofer Dutz Industrial IoT und Edge .Computing mit Apache PLC4X und Apache Edgent. @Vanced Network Meetup in Solingen: Christofer Dutz Open-Source in der .Industrie mit Apache PLC4X. Apache Roadshow EU in Berlin: Christofer Dutz - Revolutionizing the .Production Industry with Apache PLC4X.A blog post in a major corporate tech-blog has been published with the.content of the JavaSPEKTRUM article on Apache Edgent and Apache PLC4X:.https://blog.codecentric.de/2018/06/edge-computing-industrial-iot-apache-edge.nt-apache-plc4x/.As a direct result on a talk in Berlin about mentoring new committers,.we have started creating “low-hanging-fruit” tagged issues and have.started promoting them. As a result we have 2 potential contributors.interested in tackling these. Hopefully this will result in continued.activity from their side.We have reached out to a developer offering Modbus, EthernetIP and.OPC-UA drivers on his Github page to get him to join our efforts.The dev-list subscriptions has gone up by 7 (now 29) from the last.report.We now have a Twitter account: https://twitter.com/ApachePlc4x as.another channel of communicating interesting PLC4X facts. After.tweeting a lot about our project, the number of followers to that has.drastically increased to 41.How has the project developed since the last report?.We have setup a VPN for the CI server and other committers to be able.to communicate with real PLCs, however this feature has not proven to.improve the involvement of other committers so far.We have recently found a set of git repos with Apache licensed code.for accessing Modbus, Ethernet/IP and UPC-UA devices. We have reached.out to the original developer to maybe get him on board with our team.How would you assess the podling's maturity?.We have a mix of new participants and experienced Apache people.involved. So far, the new participants have shown great willingness.and success in adopting the Apache Way. However, we still need to.continue: the on-boarding increasing the diversity of the team Also,.will we need to decide and establish all the processes involved in.releasing software at Apache.Please feel free to add your own commentary.
