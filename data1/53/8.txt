Airavata is a software toolkit which provides features to compose, manage,.execute, and monitor large scale applications and workflows on computational.resources ranging from local clusters to national grids and computing clouds.Airavata is incubating since May 2011.A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards.graduation. 1. The barrier of entry in contributing to Airavata seems to be high. The code, documentation and JIRA issues have to be efficiently. organized and managed to appeal to wider developer community. 2. Develop a strong community with organizational diversity and well. aligned with existing ASF projects as outlined here:. http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/AiravataProposal#Alignment. 3. Create a regular and predictable release process and schedule.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?. Whilst our community is reasonably large and active we do not, at present,. have significant diversity, but are working on it. Right now most of the. contributors that are active are from Indiana University. Chris from JPL. is involved very closely from a mentoring perspective and will try and get. involved code wise. The 0.2 release candidate is currently VOTE'ing and. DISCUSS'ing.How has the community developed since the last report?. No new committers or PPMC members elected in the last quarter. Decent. discussion on the dev and user lists, with the sporadic user coming by. and expressing interest.How has the project developed since the last report?. - 0.1-incubating release was cancelled, and are now VOTE'ing on. 0.2-incubating release candidate (skipped 0.1-incubating numbering. - Process surrounding the release is under discussion on the DISCUSS. thread. Following the Rave process which seems to have worked for them.Signed off by mentor: mattmann, ate, rgardler.
