Myriad enables co-existence of Apache Hadoop YARN and Apache Mesos together.on the same cluster and allows dynamic resource allocations across both.Hadoop and other applications running on the same physical data center.infrastructure.Myriad has been incubating since 2015-03-01.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Determine the best way to take github pull requests or ReviewBoard patch. (chains) and apply/commit them to the Myriad git repo. We're looking at. Mesos' apply-review.sh script, but I wonder if there's something else. out there we should be considering. Is there a way to make github. 'Merge' integration just work, even through the mirror?. 2. Vote in and onboard new committers. Two are in progress, one from a new. contributing organization. 3. Prepare our first release under Apache. We'll update the code's. copyright/namespace and packaging, but we still need to learn the other. elements of the Apache release process. Is this "DRAFT" still the best. resource? https://incubator.apache.org/guides/releasemanagement.html.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. None beyond the above-mentioned.How has the community developed since the last report?. - Mailing list traffic has significantly increased from 60-80. messages/month in April-July to 171 in August and 227 in September. Some. of that could be JIRA integration, but we still have 17 unique human. authors now, up from 13 in July. - Increasing participation in our biweekly community syncs. We now get. around 7-11 participants, up from the 5-8 we were getting in May-July. See minutes at: http://s.apache.org/8kF. . - Wiki: Ruth has done a wonderful job populating and organizing the wiki. from our scattered docs. Now we have 24 wiki pages describing use cases,. architecture, installation/configuration, administration, and the REST. API. https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MYRIAD/Myriad+Home. - Website under development, with awesome Myriad logo. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MYRIAD-144 preview at. http://klucar.github.io/myriad-site/. - We started a #myriad IRC channel on Freenode, and are in the process of. integrating it with ASFBot. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-10485. - Well-attended talk by Mohit and Santosh at MesosCon. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU2VE08fOD4. - Swapnil, Sarjeet, and Mitra won 1st place in freestyle category at docker. global hack day for docker based multi-tenant YARN/Myriad clusters. https://blog.docker.com/2015/09/docker-global-hack-day-3-winners/.How has the project developed since the last report?. - Finally got the SGA from Paypal and migrated our source to Apache git!. Still need to figure how to integrate it into our commit workflow. - Resolved 14 JIRAs: http://s.apache.org/3dc. - Merged the following PRs (from the old github repo Multi-project build changes (PR#108 Improved unit testing (PR#112 Myriad Logo update (PR#113 Dynamically configurable NM Ports (PR#102 Fine-grained scaling (PR#91 Upgrade to Hadoop 2.7 (PR#116 Complete Myriad HA Implementation (PR#123 Run MyriadExecutor as NodeManager AuxService (PR#118,123.Date of last release:. Santosh will release manage the Myriad 0.1.0 release, our first release. under Apache. We created a 0.1.0 version tag in JIRA, and targeted some. pre-release issues for Apache copyright/namespace changes. We'll try to. merge in some outstanding PRs, but there are no other feature blockers, so. we hope to cut our first release candidate this month.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?. - One new committer has been privately nominated and voted in, awaiting.
