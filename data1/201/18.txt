River is aimed at the development and advancement of the Jini technology core infrastructure Jini technology is a service oriented architecture that defines a programming model which both exploits and extends Java technology to enable the construction of secure, distributed systems which are adaptive to change.This reporting period showed almost no activity, which is quite disappointing. Based on the question by one of our mentors "What's up with River" it became clear some active committers were forced to downsize their participation due to being drowned by other activities, in case of many of the Sun committers this is due to a change of jobs.There are however signs that others, well known in the Jini community, want to lend their hand and help with getting out our next release.Things that needs to be done before graduation:.the API in the com.sun namespace must be changed to org.apache, probably has to await the incorporation of patches lingering around and after our automated test framework is in place.overall participation of non Sun committers must increase and we should grow our community by getting more people involved.Incubating since: December 2006.
