Apache SIS is a toolkit that spatial information system builders or users can use to build applications containing location context. This project will look to store reference implementations of spatial algorithms, utilities, services, etc. as well as serve as a sandbox to explore new ideas. Further, the goal is to have Apache SIS grow into a thriving Apache top-level community, where a host of SIS/GIS related software (OGC datastores, REST-ful interfaces, data standards, etc.) can grow from and thrive under the Apache umbrella. Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.Not at this time. Community progress since the last report.SIS released its first release, 0.1-incubating, to the open source community in November 2010. Since then, we have focused primarily on getting the word out about the SIS project and have garnered some initial interest in the release and subsequent features. Chris Mattmann has lead efforts to work with Patrick O'Leary to identify future developments for the SIS project and how it can work with existing spatial needs. Project progress since last report.SIS was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on February 21, 2010.Development progress since the 0.1-incubating release has been modest, focusing primarily on the community development mentioned above. There has been some internal effort at JPL to integrate SIS into ongoing projects such as the CO2 Portal, the CMDS project and others. We expect development to start moving more quickly again with the new year, beginning the push towards 0.2-incubating.Signed off by mentor: mattmann, kevan.
