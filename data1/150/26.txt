Logging for C++.log4cxx2 has been incubating since 2013-12-09.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Create a release. 2. Activate some community. 3.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. There's an ongoing discussion to move the project to attic unless it is. able to release in the next few months.How has the community developed since the last report?. Not grown. However, the project aims to become a sub project of Apache. Logging again. Community growth is not much a matter for this podling, as. long as there are a few active contributors.How has the project developed since the last report?. After the discussion about the activity of the project and the success of. the incubation process, there's currently a member willing to step through. the release process. The initial plan on incubation anyway was to primary. apply available patches and release those bug fixes. Additionally, there's once more a discussion about the supported build. platforms, because currently the project heavily focusses on cpptasks,. which is not maintained and simply doesn't support current versions of all. formerly supported IDEs anymore. The current focus is on dropping. cpptasks and ANT for the build of the software and use autoconf and/or. cmake instead.Date of last release:. 2008-04-03 was the last official, pre-incubation 0.10.0.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?.Signed-off-by:.
