Droids is a new Incubator project recently arrived from Apache Labs (end October) It's an intelligent standalone robot framework that allows one to create and extend existing web robots.Things are charging along in Droids. The code has been moved over in SVN, a website setup, JIRA project migrated and a wiki location defined. There is much coding and redesign activity from the initial 3 committers and Thorsten successfully seeded interest in Droids at both BarCamp and FastFeather Talks at ApacheCon US.Now the focus is on evolving the design and building a larger community.
