Gora is an ORM framework for column stores such as Apache HBase and Apache Cassandra with a specific focus on Hadoop.A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation. 1. Port Gora code and license headers into ASF license headers. 2. Develop a strong community with organizational diversity and with infection into existing ASF projects like Nutch and Hadoop. 3. At least one Gora incubating release .Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.No, not at this time.How has the community developed since the last report?.The IPMC and Gora PPMC have elected to add Alexis Detreglode as a Gora committer and PPMC member.Mailing list activity has been picking up. We've recently been fielding questions and even a patch from some of our users who are interesting in helping to maintain a Maven-based version of the build system. .How has the project developed since the last report?.Gora was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on September 26, 2010.The project is currently rolling RC3 of our first 0.1-incubating release. Henry Saputra and Andrzej Bialecki are leading the way. .The first 2 release candidates were tested, and we have been working with the Incubator and Gora communities to address all of the issues raised. We expect Apache Gora 0.1-incubating to be released within the month, and expect Nutch 2.0-trunk to upgrade to the Gora release shortly thereafter.Signed off by mentor: mattmann .
