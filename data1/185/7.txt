OpenWebBeans will be an ASL-licensed implementation of the Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java EE Specification which is defined as JSR-299.OpenWebBeans entered the incubator in October 26, 2008. The following items have been made after the last report.We released the M2 version.We created additional documentation in the wiki page.We implemented full blown JSF + JPA + OWB application that shows usage of the OpenWebBeans.Gurkan Erdogdu replaces Matthias Wessendorf seat on the JSR-299 EG.Belows are the next steps;.We will release the M3 version.We will create more documentation in the wiki.We will continue to attract new committers into the project.There are some concerns related with the specification and its implementation,.JSR-299 specification has changed so much from the last draft. It has been having a negative impact on the implementation.Last draft specification has a tight integration with Java EE's other specifications so that integration with an EJB, Servlet, Managed Beans etc. with the OWB is unavoidable. So, we have to work closely with other Apache Teams who have been implementing aferomentioned specifications to fully implement the JSR-299 and to pass TCK.
