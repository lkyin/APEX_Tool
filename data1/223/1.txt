Subversion entered the Incubator on November 7, 2009 Subversion is a version control system.Mailing lists have been migrated to ASF infrastructure. As of Dec. 10th, the development mailing list has fully migrated over with the old tigris.org dev@ list being shut down. A users@ list has been created on ASF infrastructure and is being used, but there are a number of published references to the old tigris.org users@ address, so we are still discussing that transition - that should be complete within the next month. No progress has been made to backfill archives, though some discussion has occurred. (Backfilling of archives is not required for graduation.The Subversion project has merged its source code history into the One True Repo at svn.apache.org. The old repository on svn.collab.net has been put in read-only mode, and all new development is happening on svn.apache.org. Most, if not all, active Subversion contributors have filed their ICLAs, and are continuing development on the new infrastructure.The most recent RAT report for Subversion shows only 70 unknown licensed files, down from more than 200 a couple of weeks ago. Work continues on either removing inappropriately licensed files from the distribution tarballs or adding licenses to files found deficient.The community plans to create a new patch release, Subversion 1.6.7, before the end of the year. Although this release will be made under the old license (to avoid having to relicense mountains of code on the release branch), the release process will be observed and monitored by the Incubator PMC as part of the podling's progress toward graduation.The podling remains optimistic that a rapid progression to graduation is possible in the next month or two.Signed off by mentor: GregStein, jerenkrantz
