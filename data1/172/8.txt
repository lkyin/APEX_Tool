Apache ODE is an implementation of the BPEL4WS and WS-BPEL specifications for web services orchestration ODE entered incubation in March 2006.Activity related to incubation:.Thanks to Cliff Schmidt, we've finally cleared the BPEL4WS and WS-BPEL specifications intellectual property and patents issues. See http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/www-legal-discuss/200612.mbox/%3c906BAFB9-4176-42D8-B9D3-1ED05414FF6C@apache.org%3e for details.We're almost finished replacing Hibernate with OpenJPA, Hibernate is our last license-related issue.Activity related to project development:.We've created a much better site at http://incubator.apache.org/ode. We still need to add more documentation but the principal is already there.We've added a connector for JBI (ServiceMix) and another one with SCA (Tuscany) is in progress.Development is still very active, we've added more features and also improved stability.To complete before graduation:.Now that most IP issues have been resolved we need to release. This will hopefully help us for the next point.We need to attract more committers and encourage diversity.So the plan for the next period is to finish the transition to OpenJPA and build a release most probably in January.
