FtpServer is an implementation of RFC959 and related protocols.Community.Voted to add new commiter, Dave Roberts. Actually CLA registration and account setup still in progress.The mail traffic on the dev list has increase the last couple of months, probably due to more active development again.But, we still don't have a large community backing FtpServer. More active communication about the project might be needed.Code and documentation.Migration to Maven 2 complete.Integration with MINA almost complete. When done, MINA will be the default choice for socket handling. Our old code will remain to support FTP and FTPS on Java 1.4 platforms.We are getting close to a sufficiently complete code for doing a first milestone release soon.Documentation has been migrated to the Confluence wiki. We expect this will make our documentation easier to maintain and up-to-date.
