The full status of incubation is here In summary we're most of the way through incubation now, things have been progressing very well; the code is clean and using only Apache-compliant libraries, it has the correct copyright notices and is in the org.apache.activemq namespace and is generally working well now. We've got the software grants sorted and most developers have their CLAs on file and accounts created (we've a few more to do once we know the CLAs are on file.We've voted on a milestone release which should go out soon once we've figured out the practicalities of doing an incuabtor milestone release. Our main outstanding issue now is creating the full website at Apache - which should be done in the next week or two - for now there is a simple home page.
