Logging for C++.log4cxx2 has been incubating since 2013-12-09.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. We probably need to decide what's an acceptable platform/compiler. list, sort out any remaining hiccups, and then move towards a. release. 2. We need to publish the project site with updated content to. reflect the new status and fix documentation bugs. 3. We need to make a broader use of the ASF infrastructure. (notably the CI, as well as improved management of the Jira. site - notably with triaging), and establish a roadmap for. the next releases.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?.
