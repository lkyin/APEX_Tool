Easyant is a build system based on Apache Ant and Apache Ivy.EasyAnt has been incubating since 2011-01-31.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. doing a release: it will show that the EasyAnt committers are dedicated to maintain it and keep it going. 2. shortly after that, ask the Ant PMC again to accept EasyAnt as a subproject. 3. if accepted, EasyAnt could then leave the Incubator.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?. None.How has the community developed since the last report?. No progress. There was only one thread on the mailing list. That thread from few days ago was about releasing.How has the project developed since the last report?. Since the last report, there was some activities on svn. A release is scheduled just after the Apache Ivy one (EasyAnt has a dependency on it), Ivy release which is under way.Please check this when you have filled in the report for EasyAnt.Signed-off-by:.Anthony Elder: (easyantAntoine LÃ©vy-Lambert: (easyantStefan Bodewig: (easyant.Shepherd notes: good report.
