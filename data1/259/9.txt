BlueSky has been incubating since 01-12-2008 It is an e-learning solution designed to help solve the disparity in availability of qualified education between well-developed cities and poorer regions of China.Finally we committed our source code, though part of the source code, to SVN repository. Now the most urgent things for us is to replace FFmpeg with Theora and Vorbis. We've started to learn Theora and Vorbis but not too much progress were gained. Another bad news is that we are now severely short of hands. Some students are gonna graduate in days. Thus we have to enroll some undergraduate students to our lab. We've already got one and he is now getting familiar with our system. I hope that his participation would help.Next step:.Continue to learn Theora and Vorbis, try to replace FFmpeg soon;.
