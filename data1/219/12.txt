Stdcxx status report for the calendar quarter ending in 12/2005:This is the second quarterly report for stdcxx.The stdcxx community has spent the last three months working toward version 4.1.3 of the project. The major accomplishments thus far include the completion of the test suite driver (STDCXX-4), the migration of a large number (but not all) of stdcxx tests from the Rogue C++ Standard Library test suite to this driver and to the ASF Subversion repository (STDCXX-4), and the creation of a Windows configuration and build infrastructure (STDCXX-5, STDCXX-13.The successful completion of these objectives marks an important milestone for the stdcxx project. To facilitate the migration of existing users of the Rogue Wave C++ Standard Library to stdcxx, the stdcxx community is currently in the process of releasing version 4.1.3 of the project. This release has been scheduled to coincide with the release of the Rogue Wave C++ Standard Library 4.1.3 on which stdcxx is based. A vote to release stdcxx 4.1.3 is under way on stdcxx-dev.In other news, the stdcxx PPMC recently voted to extend an offer of committership to Anton Pevtsov. Anton is the author of the Windows build infrastructure and his help with porting the test suite over the last few months has been essential. In addition, in preparation for graduation and the forming of a PMC, the stdcxx PPMC has started to discuss expanding its membership from the current 5 (including 3 mentors) to involve other active committers.Going forward, the most important goals of the growing stdcxx community continue to be to increase the visibility of the project and further increase the number as well as diversity of its users, contributors, and committers, finish porting the stdcxx test suite, and implement a complete test harness for the project to facilitate automated nightly testing. Other goals include expanding the set of platforms to Apple Darwin and other BSD-based operating systems, enhancing support for the C++ Standard Library extensions described in the (Draft) Technical Report on C++ Library Extensions.
