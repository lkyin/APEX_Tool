SystemML provides declarative large-scale machine learning (ML) that aims at.flexible specification of ML algorithms and automatic generation of hybrid.runtime plans ranging from single node, in-memory computations, to distributed.computations running on Apache Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark.SystemML has been incubating since 2015-11-02.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Grow SystemML community: increase mailing list activity, increase. adoption of SystemML for scalable machine learning, encourage data. scientists to adopt DML and PyDML algorithm scripts, respond to user. feedback to ensure SystemML meets the requirements of real-world. situations, write papers, and present talks about SystemML. 2. Continue to produce releases. 3. Increase the diversity of our project's contributors and committers.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. NONE.How has the community developed since the last report?. Our mailing list from November through January had 249 messages on a. variety of topics. We gained 2 new contributors to the project since. November 1. On GitHub, the project has been starred 451 times and forked. 168 times. Elgamal et al wrote the paper "SPOOF: Sum-Product Optimization. and Operator Fusion for Large-Scale Machine Learning," which was presented. at CIDR'17 in January.How has the project developed since the last report?. The main project has had 114 commits since November 1. 90 pull requests. have been created since November 1, and 79 pull requests have been closed. Since November 1, 143 issues have been reported on our JIRA site and 64 of. these have been resolved or closed.Date of last release:. 2016-11-13 (version 0.11.0-incubating.When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?. 2017-01-19 Nakul Jindal (Committer and PPMC.Signed-off-by:.
