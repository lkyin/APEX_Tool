Woden is a Java class library for reading, validating, manipulating, creating and writing WSDL documents, initially to support WSDL 20 and with the longer term aim of supporting past, present and future versions of WSDL.Woden entered the Incubator in April 2005. The Woden team have made six releases since then and have been included in the release of the Apache Axis2 project. Our current set of active committers consists of four from IBM, one from WSO2 and one from University of Moratuwa. If there are any concerns on whether we would graduate if a vote was put to the Incubator PMC, then it is diversity of the committer base. We would appreciate feedback on this point.Recent activity since our last report in August:.Woden M6 was released in October which introduced a StAX parser based implementation of the Woden API and improved the compliance with the WSDL 2.0 specification.In November, three of the Woden committers attended the W3C Web Services Description Working Group "Second Interoperability Event on WSDL 2.0" in Dinard, France. Two others participated remotely.
