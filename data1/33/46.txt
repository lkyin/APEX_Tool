(s2graph) Woonsan Ko.Comments: In my visit in Seoul, I met the three active committers - Daewon, Do Yung and Hwansung - over lunch, chatting informally face-to-face for the first time about how to grow our community. There has not been much project / community activity for last 1 year, but they were passionate to stay in the community and started reorganizing their work/time, trying to improve developer's experience and accessibility, considering to support Java Client or even Spring Boot for new people, by which they believe they can help grow the community. There's no specific decision made yet but we agreed to continue discussion in the mailinglist. It was great for me as a mentor too to understand each other. See [1] for detail.IPMC/Shepherd notes:.
