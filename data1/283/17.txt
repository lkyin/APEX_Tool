iPMC Reviewers: jukka, bdelacretaz, yoavs, jimThe last word of discussion some 3 months ago was about infra, the creation of the lokahi wiki site. It has since been unused. Some banter on the tail end of ApacheCon EU/07 included ideas about docs and deployment help, and some ideas about DB backends.The last commit activity in the same timeframe were the beginnings of a jackrabbit connector, no other activity for commits@ since then.There has been no activity on private.iPMC Comments:.Mentors are seriously looking for ideas from the Lokahi community how we.can help identify that this project still has energy, as mentors had to.submit this belated report due back in Aug. Will expect to have something.to report coming up in the November report. [wrowe].I'm personally concerned with the continued lack of energy. It's such a good.project on paper. [yoavs]
