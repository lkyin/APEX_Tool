IPMC reviews: jukka, jim.Description - Buildr is a build system for Java applications written in Ruby. Date of Entry - Nov. 2007.Development.Buildr 1.3 is now in feature freeze and we're working to fix outstanding bugs, complete the documentation and add more test cases. As indicated in the previous report, we worked on multi-language support, adding Scala and Groovy to the mix, and also using RSpec (Ruby) to test Java code. JRuby 1.1 is now an official deployment platform for Buildr, alongside MRI 1.8.Community.Traffic on the mailing list is definitely picking up, as are feature requests and bug reports. Victor Hugo Borja joined as committer.Issues before graduation.Legal has addressed our licensing issues specific to Ruby project, and we're ready to make a 1.3 release. From then it's business as usual: continuing to build a healthy community around Buildr.
