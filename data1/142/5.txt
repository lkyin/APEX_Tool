(introduced to Apache incubator on Jul 4, 2011.Kafka provides an extremely high throughput distributed publish/subscribe messaging system. Additionally, it supports relatively long term persistence of messages to support a wide variety of consumers, partitioning of the message stream across servers and consumers, and functionality for loading data into Apache Hadoop for offline, batch processing.A list of the most important issues to address in the move towards graduation. 1. Invite diverse new active committers.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.We incurred significant overhead during our first release; see http://apache.markmail.org/message/rsxjgrrufc6khlqy?q=list:org%2Eapache%2Eincubator%2Egeneral+from:%22junrao%22 for reference. Firstly, there is no good example to follow for a new podling. Secondly, the licensing rules are complex and the documentation is not enough for a new podling to understand. This gets more complicated since different IPMC members have different views and apply those rules slightly differently. This delays releases and causes overhead to the team. We hope that some of these things can be addressed to make the process easier to other projects.How has the community developed since the last report?.Activities in the mailing list increased 4x since the last report. Several patches from non-committers have been submitted, reviewed and committed.How has the project developed since the last report?.We have successfully completed the first release of Kafka after joining the incubator. This releases adds the end-to-end compression feature and mirroring support in Kafka. In addition to this, it also fixes more than 40 issues. .Signed off by mentor: cdouglas.Alan Cabrera.
