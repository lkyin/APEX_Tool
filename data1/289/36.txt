Olio is a web 2.0 toolkit to help developers evaluate the suitability,.functionality and performance of various web technologies by implementing.a reasonably complex application in several different technologies.Olio entered incubation in October 2008.There is no development activity on this project. There was at least 1 new user in the last quarter who used Olio.Graduation From Incubation:.The user base is not showing growth. Since this is a test application/workload,.it is being used as such for short-term projects.I think the decision was made to simply keep the project so users can continue to access it.
