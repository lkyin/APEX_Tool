Apache Shiro is a powerful and flexible open-source application security framework that cleanly handles authentication, authorization, enterprise session management and cryptography.Apache Shiro has been incubating since June 2008.Due to potential naming conflicts with the previously chosen name of 'Ki', the ASF community at large helped us change our name to 'Shiro'. This was a large collaborative effort that really showed the power of the Apache Way and resulted in a name with which a large majority of people were content.Project infrastructure has been switched over to support this name change and.all seems to be running well. We have yet to properly configure Hudson for.continuous integration builds, but that should be done shortly. The new CWIKI.space is available here: http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SHIRO.The name change also affords us to start publishing incubator Maven snapshot builds.which will help foster adoption to all Maven end-users (which there are many.We're very happy to report that the the name change and community support resulting.from it have allowed the development team to return focus to developing the framework and resolving issues rather than spending time on name-related administrative issues.The project team is not considering graduation at this point, as the code is not ready for an Apache release. Once IP clearance is complete, and Mavne snapshots are working, we'll attempt our first incubator release.The status is being maintained at http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/shiro/STATUS.
