Empire-db is a relational data access layer offering special benefits over other solutions through string-free dynamic query generation, metadata access and improved compile-time safety.Empire-db has been accepted to the incubator in July 2008.Recent activity:.In October only a few minor bug fixes and improvements for both the core database component and the Struts2 extensions library have been provided.Still on our list is the maven support for the upcoming 2.0.5 release. Another idea is to provide an example for how to integrate Web-Services in a Web-Application using Empire-dbâ€™s metadata capabilities.There are also plans for providing integration with Apache Wicket, which could be a new subproject just like the Empire-db Struts2 extensions. This however is a task that would take a few months to develop.Community aspects:.In order to increase our community and make people more aware of the capabilities and benefits of Empire-db we have submitted a proposal for a presentation at the Apache Con Europe 2009 in Amsterdam. We are waiting to hear from the conference committee any time soon.
