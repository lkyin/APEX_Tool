Apache MXNet is an open-source deep learning framework that allows you to define, train, and deploy deep neural networks on a wide array of devices, from cloud infrastructure to mobile devices. It is highly scalable, allowing for fast model training, and supports a flexible programming model and multiple languages. MXNet allows you to mix symbolic and imperative programming flavors to maximize both efficiency and productivity. MXNet is built on a dynamic dependency scheduler that automatically parallelizes both symbolic and imperative operations on the fly. A graph optimization layer on top of that makes symbolic execution fast and memory efficient. The MXNet library is portable and lightweight, and it scales to multiple GPUs and multiple machines.Apache MXNet has been incubating since 2017-01-23.The most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Establish a predictable release process consistent with Apache Way -- Ongoing. 2. Grow the Community - Ongoing . 3. Update project website to Apache standards - In Progress. 4. Identify remaining ICLAs and SGAs that need to be addressed - in progress.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. None.How has the community developed since the last report?. a) Various Slack channels and dev@ mailing lists are being used actively. New user support and discussion forum created with the guidance of Apache members at: http://discuss.mxnet.io . b) O’Reilly published a series of blogs about MXNet, including ones with step-by-step instructions to implement a convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs with Apache MXNet:.https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/classifying-traffic-signs-with-mxnet-an-introduction-to-computer-vision-with-neural-networks.https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/apache-mxnetthe-fruit-of-cross-institutional-collaboration.https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/self-driving-trucks-enter-the-fast-lane-using-deep-learning. c) A new blog post published on 28-July showing users how to exploit the unique features of Apache MXNet with a cheat sheet: 	 https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/ai/exploiting-the-unique-features-of-the-apache-mxnet-deep-learning-framework-with-a-cheat-sheet/.d) New Blog series by Viacheslav Kovalevskyi on Apache MxNet in Depth published on Medium https://blog.kovalevskyi.com/mxnet-distributed-training-explained-in-depth-part-1-b90c84bda725.e) Members of the community have conducted open meetups to share information on Apache MXNet: https://www.meetup.com/Apache-MXNet-learning-group/.f) Talks on Apache MXNet have been held in various universities and conferences across the world including US, China, etc.:.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBkOMtc9BIk.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGktiYF5upk.g) Presently working towards an upcoming 0.12.0 release targeted for October or November 2017. . .How has the project developed since the last report?.a) The code base was migrated from http://github.com/dmlc/mxnet to https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet on 28-July, 2017. The website has also been migrated to this repository. .b) From a statistics perspective, in July 2017, 54 authors pushed 140 commits to master, with updates to 358 files including 22K additions and 3K deletions. In Sep 2017, 62 authors pushed 171 commits to master, with updates to 467 files including 26K additions and 7K deletions.c) Documentation- Architecture guides, How To’s, Tutorials, and APIs continue to be improved.d) More features (e.g. operators, algorithms) and bug-fixes requested by the user community continue to be added.How would you assess the podling's maturity?.Podling is still being established in Apache - hence maturity == Low, but the project has a very diverse set of contributors.Please feel free to add your own commentary. Initial setup. Working towards first release. Community building. Nearing graduation. Other:.Date of last release:. A maintenance release Apache MXNet-incubating 0.11.0 with few bug-fixes was released on 05-Sep, 2017. https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/releases/tag/0.11.0. A maintenance release Apache MXNet-incubating 0.10.0 Post 2 with few bug-fixes was released on 17-July, 2017. https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/releases/tag/0.10.0.post2. .When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?. Ly Nguyen, Haibin Lin and Madan Jampani were added as committers and PPMC members in June 2017.Signed-off-by:. (mxnet) Sebastian Schelter. Comments: Second Suneel's comment that the project should work towards more communication on its mailinglists. (mxnet) Suneel Marthi. Comments: Plenty of activity on the project, would love to see more discussions happening on mail lists or Slack. (mxnet) Markus Weimer. Comments:. (mxnet) Henri Yandell. Comments: Noting acknowledgement that Infra JIRA requests will be going via mentors due to both the reported . volume of requests and the requests coming from contributors and not committers. Also noting that . I've been active on legal-discuss@ regarding MXNet ICLA/source headers, and in discussion offline . with an employer of contributors who has concerns with ICLA signing. .IPMC/Shepherd notes:. johndament: The podling has come under fire recently for what is perceived to be an over abundant amount of requests coming from non-committers. If nothing else, it's a sign that they are anxious to get going here at Apache and perhaps they need to look at their communication model, moving more discussion on list, as well as potentially voting in new committers.
