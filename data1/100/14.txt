EasyAnt is a build system based on Apache Ant and Apache Ivy. Incubating since 2011-01-31.Towards graduation, we need to:. - Create a release. - Build a community.Since the last report:. In the last report we described that the activity of the podling was quite. low. Some discussion with developers and mentors raised about this concern. Developers acknowledged that the current code refactoring make it's build. break too much to keep people interested in contributing. Developers are. still motivated even if most lack of time. The conclusion is that the focus. should be on doing a release ASAP to keep things going on and bring back. stability. Some discussion started about the last points to tackle before preparing. a release.Signed off by mentor: bodewig.
