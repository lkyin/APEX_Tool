Cassandra is a distributed storage system providing reliability at a massive scale Started incubation: 01/2009. Opened to community in 03/2009.The original authors of Cassandra from facebook (Avinash and Prashant) have gone back to developing against an internal repository. We have never seen any involvement from initial committer Dan, either.Despite this setback we continue to make progress; a 0.3.0 release is imminent and two more committers have been nominated, out of six who regularly submit patches. Cassandra was represented at the recent NoSQL distributed database summit by Avinash and Jonathan and was very well received.Past action items:.Consensus about the development process. Done. Development is done in trunk with branches for releases. A pre-commit patch review process is followed that will be familiar to most apache committers.JIRA permissions and configuration. Done.A bit more information on the web site. Done.Next steps:.Get new committers voted on.Get 0.3.0 release out.
