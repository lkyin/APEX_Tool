Continue to grow community. 2. Move project development to ASF hardware. 3. Continue to remove non-AL code from the repo.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?. No issues at this time.How has the community developed since the last report?. 1. Lots of contributions from Stefano Invernizzi and Simone Gatti. 2. Small patch received from SourceForge user 'honyczek'. No other new contributors. 3. Some new faces on IRC and the mailing list. 4. Professor mentoring Stefano and Simone has expressed willingness to recruit. more students to work on Allura.How has the project developed since the last report?. 1. Allura instance set up at http://allura-vm.apache.org/ but nothing moved to it yet. Need to finish setup and address any problems before moving development to. the new vm. 2. GPL code made optional. Licensing review by Peter shows that only one. Creative Commons javascript library needs to be addressed. LICENSE and NOTICE. files created. Still need to apply Apache License header to all files.Please check this when you have filled in the report for Allura.Signed-off-by:.Ross Gardler: (alluraGreg Stein: (alluraJim Jagielski: (alluraRich Bowen: (allura.Shepherd notes:.Commit activity & mailing list traffic look good. I see that there are license issues that the podling has been dealing with, specifically removing non AL code. I am looking forward to seeing discussions about making a release in the near future.
