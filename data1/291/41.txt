Apache PhotArk will be a complete open source photo gallery application.including a content repository for the images, a display piece, an access.control layer, and upload capabilities.PhotArk was accepted for Incubation on August 19, 2008.PhotArk has a small community of contributors, mostly student, that need a.lot of attention in order to keep them active, and the lack of attention made.the community stale to almost a zero activity in the last three or four months.Currently the is a community discussion on the future of the project, and.one of the ideas that has gotten the community attention is to make PhotArk.to move away from a image repository, and become a HTML5/Cordova mobile.application that aggregates images from different photo sources such as:.Flickr, Instagram, Facebook, etc. We have also raised the question with IPMC.if we need to follow any specific process in case the community decide to.change the scope of the project, but we haven't got any answer yet.Issues before graduation :. - PhotArk started as a project with no initial code-base, and we have. grown the community to the minimal independent committer size required. for graduation. We need to make these contributors constantly active. in order to think about graduation again, or recruit new contributors.Signed off by mentor: lresende.
