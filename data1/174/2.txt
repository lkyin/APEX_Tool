Apache OGNL is a Java development framework for Object-Graph.Navigation Language, plus other extras such as list projection and.selection and lambda expressions.The project joined the Incubator on April 26, 2011. A list of the three most important issues to address in the move.towards graduation. - make at least a big release that shows to Commons PMC the.compliancy level of OGNL to Commons policies;. - attract more users, at the moment only Apache Struts people are.interested because they heavily use OGNL;. - attract new committers. Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of. - no news about Marc Andrew Davidson's even if was requested twice;. - not every PPMC member joined the private ML yet;. - due to OpenSymphony dismissing, we need importing old issues to ASF.jira. We finally contacted someone from OpenSymphony and obtained the.huge Issue dump/XML backup, there is someone that is working on it,.but due to security policy (the dump contains also users and password.hashes), before importing it, an open-heart surgery is needed. How has the community developed since the last report.Community activity decreased since codebase has been imported &.polished; we finally reached Luc Blanchard, the other OGNL original.author, that signed & submitted the OGNL SoftwareGrant & ICLA - we.also voted him as a new committer since he should have been included.in the initial committers list. How has the project developed since the last report.A reported above, codebase has been imported & polished, we are in the.middle of a big refactoring stripping off generated code by JavaCC.that was versioned in the SCM and modified.Signed off by mentor: grobmeier.
