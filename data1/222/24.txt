Apache Streams (incubating) is a lightweight (yet scalable) framework for ActivityStreams.Streams has been incubating since 2012-11-20. The project provides a framework for abstracting away individual data. schemas and API protocols from solutions built to collect, publish,. process, and analyze digital activity data, as well as a community-. driven process for determining best practice usage of the ActivityStreams. specification with real-world datasets - valuing working, tested,. adaptable, useful code over strict adherence to existing specs. Importantly, the project does not impose one execution framework -. modules built to Apache Streams interfaces and coding standards may. be instantiated within multiple JVM-based runtime containers, including. popular â€˜big-data' frameworks.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Establish and maintain a consistent release process. 2. Improve quality of code, tests, documentation, and examples. 3. PPMC must relieve project mentors of all responsibility for the. project's adherence to the Apache Way and long-term viability.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?.
