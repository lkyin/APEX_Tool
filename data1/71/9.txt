Development.We recently released Buildr 1.3.2, focusing strictly on bug fixes. 1.3.3 release scheduled for August will also focus on bug fixes and better error reporting. The bulk consists of issues reported, tested(warning) and patched by community members. There's parallel work to add C/C++ support to Buildr, currently discussed on the mailing list, and we're seeing the first set of test cases for Eclipse tasks. Our little master plan to not accept patches without test cases may work out after all.Community.In spite of our best efforts to send everyone on summer vacation, traffic is steadily picking up on the mailing list.Issues before graduation.1.3.2 cleared up some missing/mixed copyright issues that slipped past QA in earlier releases, and as of now we have no outstanding licensing issues.
