(druid) Julian Hyde Comments: In my opinion Druid is overdue to graduate. There seems to be off-list consensus that graduation is near but I would like to see more conversation on-list. I don't agree that mentors "have been very helpful"; for the record, the other two mentors have been absent, including from tight release votes. I suspect that they are fatigued.IPMC/Shepherd notes:.Justin Mclean: Elected 10 committers at once? I can see a more recent PPMC addition in March.
