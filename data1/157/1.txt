An open implementation of a Linked Data Platform.Marmotta has been incubating since 2012-12-03.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Ingest code and clear IP. 2. A release. 3. Build dev and PMC. .Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.No such issues. .How has the community developed since the last report?. Communication mechanisms have been successfully setup: the dev@marmotta mailing list has quite important traffic (274 messages in January); Jira already registers more than 50 issues; regular meetings are held at IRC, sending the minutes to the mailing list to mitigate the barriers of people in different timezones. This approach is enabling the participation of new people in the community of the project. Branding: Logo almost ready, trademarks@apache already contacted. Awaiting for the site installation. .How has the project developed since the last report?.The project is about publish the last release of the former project (LMF), to them contribute the parts that will be actually Marmotta. This last full release already advances some tasks for Marmotta, such as architectural changes and dependencies clean up. After this major milestone, the project's ambition is a rapid turnaround to get an Apache incubator release as soon as possible. .Please check this when you have filled in the report for Marmotta.Signed-off-by:.Fabian Christ: (marmottaNandana Mihindukulasooriya: (marmottaAndy Seaborne: (marmotta.Shepherd notes:.
