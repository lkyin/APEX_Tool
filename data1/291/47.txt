Apache PhotArk will be a complete open source photo gallery application.including a content repository for the images, a display piece, an access.control layer, and upload capabilities.PhotArk was accepted for Incubation on August 19, 2008.PhotArk has a small community of contributors, mostly students, that need a.lot of attention in order to keep them active. The recent move in the .project direction to become a hybrid HTML5/Cordova mobile application that .aggregates images from different photo sources has contributed to bring old .members of the community and the is also two students participating in .GSoC that have been doing a great job.The community have voted Prabhath Suminda as a new project committer, and .if finalizing the vote on another new committer as well.Issues before graduation :. PhotArk started as a project with no initial code-base, and we have. grown the community to the minimal independent committer size required. for graduation. We need to make these contributors constantly active. in order to think about graduation again, or recruit new contributors. If the project can sustain the same level of activity for the next three. months, I believe we could think about graduation again.Signed-off-by: lresende (mentor), jukka.IPMC comments:. jukka: Just one active mentor, though Luciano is doing great. The heavy reliance on GSoC is a diversity concern.
