River is aimed at the development and advancement of the Jini technology core infrastructure Jini technology is a service oriented architecture that defines a programming model which both exploits and extends Java technology to enable the construction of secure, distributed systems which are adaptive to change.The crypto issue mentioned in last report seems to be resolved without doing anything special as it seems to be not necessary based on the (limited) feedback in the legal mailing list.The River community decided to start with a CTR policy although we urge people to consult others before actually committing for all but the trivial cases.We decided we want to use Hudson as our continuous integration engine, but we have to wait a while for a server becomes available to deploy it on, hopefully somewhere in December/January.Work on the first release moved steady as a glacier (global warming seems to have no effect here (smile) ) and didn't require much participation of committers due to the set goals. Currently there is no outstanding work for that first release.We are picking and scheduling fixes and features for the next release and are discussing a branching strategy for SVN before we can finally release the trunk to a stampede of hungry people that will crash into the codebase to make it better.Incubating since: December 2006
