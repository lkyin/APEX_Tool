Mesos is a cluster manager that provides resource sharing and isolation across cluster applications.Mesos has been incubating since 2010-12-23.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:.1. Add more committers (see "issues" below.2. Do more releases (see "issues" below.3. Grow community (do more meetups and try and get more people interested.in hacking on codebase rather than just using the software.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware.of?.We've had issues getting enough votes for adding committers and doing.releases. We recently added a new mentor (thank you Jakob Homan!) who.promptly helped out on one of our stalled releases, but we still have yet.to conclude a committer vote (to be clear, the vote has received unanimous.+1's from all existing committers, but nothing from any mentors.How has the community developed since the last report?.We performed a "meetup" at AirBnB which drew a large crowd. The mailing.list continued to be active in December. People are generally interested.and excited about the project, but we have not gotten very many developers.working in the codebase. We hope to rectify this in the coming months by.holding some developer specific meetups to talk about working on and.contributing to the project.How has the project developed since the last report?.There were a considerable number of bug fixes, especially around the use of.Linux cgroups for doing resource isolation. There was also a lot of work.done on the slave/worker component of the system to enable upgrading Mesos.without killing all tasks/processes that it is managing.
