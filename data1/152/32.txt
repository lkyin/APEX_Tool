iPMC Reviewers: wrowe, jukka, bdelacretaz, yoavs, jimlog4php incubation was restarted in July. Three new committers have been added and a JIRA project has been set up for bug tracking. A maven 2 generated web site has been published to http://incubator.apache.org/log4php. The source tree was reorganized and an initial pass at migration to PHP 5 was committed in July, but there has been little recent activity (possibly due to vacations) and no published development plan. In the next period, the development team needs to establish development plan for an initial snapshot.
