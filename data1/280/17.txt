Kalumet a complete environment manager and deployer including J2EE environments (application servers, applications, etc), softwares, and resources.Kalumet has been incubating since 2011-09-20.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. cut off a couple of incubating releases. 2. we identified "high" priority features/changes for 0.7.0-incubating release. Kscripts and different "ecosystems" (OSGi, JavaEE, etc) providers could be included in this release.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?. None so far.How has the community developed since the last report?. We submitted a couple of Kalumet 0.6.0-incubating releases to vote. Unfortunately, due to "discussion" around legal files (especially NOTICE), the votes didn't pass. We are fixing the legal issue and will submit a new 0.6.0-incubating release to vote.How has the project developed since the last report?. We created the Jira corresponding to the changes that we want to include in Kalumet 0.7.0-incubating release. We decided to increase the release cycle in order to give more visibility to the users. We completed a first documentation. The documentation is part of the 0.6.0-incubating release and is also available directly on the website.Please check this when you have filled in the report for Kalumet.Signed-off-by:.Jim Jagielski: (kalumetHenri Gomez: (kalumetJean-Baptiste Onofre: [ X ](kalumetOlivier Lamy: (kalumet.Shepherd notes:.I am a concerned about the recent drop in activity for the podling. There was a flurry of mail around the 0.6.0-incubating release and very little of substance since then, with absolutely nothing in the month of February. I wouldn't be so concerned if the vote was successful; but, since it was a cancelled vote, I would have assumed the community would try to fix the issues and get it out as soon as possible. These observations are, of course, made from a quick review, so I could be missing an important detail.
