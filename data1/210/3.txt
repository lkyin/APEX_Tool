2009-October Shiro Incubator status report.Shiro is a powerful and flexible open-source application security framework that cleanly handles authentication, authorization, enterprise session management and cryptography.Shiro has been incubating since June 2008.We are very excited to report we have added Kalle Korhonen as our first new committer since joining the incubator. This marks a big project milestone for us as we continue to grow our community.There remain a few project infrastructure inconsistencies resulting from our previous name change as described in this email thread: http://tinyurl.com/yznnogv.Resolving these inconsistencies are a high priority and should be resolved as soon as possible.An issue of how Shiro is configured was the largest issue impeding our first Apache release. That issue has been largely resolved and once finalized, we should be able to focus on our first Apache release.The project team is not considering graduation at this point, as the code is not ready for an Apache release. Once IP clearance is complete, we'll attempt our first incubator release.The status is being maintained at http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/shiro/STATUS.Signed off by mentor: Craig L Russell.
