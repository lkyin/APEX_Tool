SAMOA provides a collection of distributed streaming algorithms for the most common data mining and machine learning tasks such as classification, clustering, and regression, as well as programming abstractions to develop new algorithms that run on top of distributed stream processing engines (DSPEs) It features a pluggable architecture that allows it to run on several DSPEs such as Apache Storm, Apache S4, and Apache Samza.SAMOA has been incubating since 2014-12-15.Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:.Revitalize the project by resuming development.Enlarge the user base and contributing community.Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?.None.How has the community developed since the last report?.Mailing list activity:.@dev: 4 messages.How has the project developed since the last report?.We are working in an implementation of adaptive random forests.How would you assess the podling's maturity?.Please feel free to add your own commentary. Community building.Date of last release:.2020-04-23.When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?.August 2019.Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?.There are no mentors since June.Is the PPMC managing the podling's brand / trademarks?.Yes. There are no 3rd parties incorrectly using the podlingâ€˜s name and brand for now.Signed-off-by:.IPMC/Shepherd notes:.Justin Mclean: I suggest you reach out the the IPMC general list and ask for more mentors. Given the low activity it may be hard to attract one. Can the project point to me to where this development on adaptive random forests is? There doesn't seem to be any commits for almost a year.
