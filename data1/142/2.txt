(introduced to Apache incubator on Jul 4, 2011.Kafka provides an extremely high throughput distributed publish/subscribe messaging system. Additionally, it supports relatively long term persistence of messages to support a wide variety of consumers, partitioning of the message stream across servers and consumers, and functionality for loading data into Apache Hadoop for offline, batch processing.A list of the most important issues to address in the move towards graduation. 1. Successful podling release. 2. Invite diverse new active committers.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.Not at this time.How has the community developed since the last report?.We are getting very close to release the very first version of Kafka in Apache. A couple of RCs have been proposed and we are still fixing various license header issues reported by rat. The proposed RC fixed more than 40 issues. The main feature added in the RC is end-to-end compression support.How has the project developed since the last report?.Activities in the mailing list remain high. Several patches from non-committers have been submitted, reviewed and committed.Signed off by mentor:.Alan Cabrera.
