Apache PhotArk will be a complete open source photo gallery application.including a content repository for the images, a display piece, an access.control layer, and upload capabilities.PhotArk was accepted for Incubation on August 19, 2008.PhotArk has a small community of contributors, mostly student, that need a.lot of attention in order to keep them active, and the lack of attention made.the community stale for a bit and we are starting to bootstrap it again.with some committers becoming active again, and other like myself freeing.up to be able to work on the project again.The community have also decided to move the project direction to become a.hybrid HTML5/Cordova mobile application that aggregates images from.different photo sources such as: Flickr, Instagram, Facebook, etc. And.we will have two students helping on this project as part of GSoC 2012.Issues before graduation :. PhotArk started as a project with no initial code-base, and we have. grown the community to the minimal independent committer size required. for graduation. We need to make these contributors constantly active. in order to think about graduation again, or recruit new contributors.Signed off by mentor: lresende.
