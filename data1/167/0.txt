Just started incubation, nothing specific to report at this time.How has the community developed since the last report?. We are approximately 2 weeks into the incubation process. 1. Core infrastructure has been set up. Core contributors have completed . their ICLAâ€™s. Apache accounts, mailing lists, JIRA, and website are in. place. 2. First drop of documentation is linked to the incubator website on AFS. 3. Participation on the @dev mailing list was seen with installation. queries and troubleshooting questions from mentors and 1 new. subscriber.How has the project developed since the last report?. Early activity:. 1. Initial code drop on Apache git repository for Mynewt RTOS for M4 and. M3 architectures in debug environment. 2. Initial code drop on Apache git repository for newt tool to build basic. RTOS images . 3. Core infrastructure is set up.Date of last release:. No release yet.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?. Initial list of committers have been on-boarded. No new members added on top of the initial committer list.Signed-off-by:.
