A Flexible and Efficient Library for Deep Learning.MXNet has been incubating since 2017-01-23.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:.1. Establish a predictable release process consistent with Apache Way --. ONGOING.2. Grow the community -- ONGOING.3. Bring website up to Apache standard -- ONGOING.4. Identify remaining ICLAs or SGAs that need signing -- ONGOING.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware.of?. None.How has the community developed since the last report?.a) Various Slack channels, dev@ mailing lists, and user discussion forums.(http://discuss.mxnet.io) are being used actively. The contributors have been.working on having all discussions on the public dev@ mailing list as much as.possible. This is an ongoing improvement process where the focus will be to.reduce the scope of private discussions to only a few individuals before it is.put on the public dev@ mailing list so that the Apache MXNet community gets a.fair chance in influencing the final outcome/decision of the discussion. b) O'Reilly published a series of blogs about MXNet:.https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/anomaly-detection-with-apache-mxnet.https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/logo-detection-using-apache-mxnet.https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/generative-model-using-apache-mxnet.https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/build-a-recurrent-neural-network-using-apache-mxnet.c) A new blog post published on 5-Feb about MXNet Model Server for Apache.MXNet introduces ONNX support and Amazon CloudWatch integration.https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/model-server-for-apache-mxnet-introduces-onnx-support-and-amazon-cloudwatch-integration/.d) A new blog post published on 13-Mar about MXNet - Deploy Gluon Models to.AWS DeepLens using a simple Python API.https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/deploy-gluon-models-to-aws-deeplens-using-a-simple-python-api/.e) Borealis AI (AI lab of Royal Bank of Canada) published a new blog post on.Feb about the comparison between PyTorch and MXNet Standardizing a machine.learning framework for applied research PyTorch vs MXNet.http://www.borealisai.com/2018/02/16/standardizing-a-machine-learning-framework-for-applied-research/.f) Microsoft AI research published a new blog post on Mar about the.performance comparison between multiple frameworks including MXNet Comparing.deep learning frameworks: A Rosetta stone approach.https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2018/03/14/comparing-deep-learning-frameworks-a-rosetta-stone-approach/.g) Beeva Labs published a new blog post on Feb about MXNet Accelerating the.training of deep neural networks with MXNet on AWS P3 instances.https://www.bbva.com/en/accelerate-training-deep-neural-networks-mxnet-aws-p3-instances/.h) Webinars and talks on Apache MXNet on the social media platform:.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSNvm29kIAo.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kINQpQiee7g.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWgCbjtsAAM.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjDTL_Kjfww.i) Thomas Delteil spoke at Meetup in Vancouver -.https://www.meetup.com/LearnDataScience/events/248473200/?rv=ea1&_xtd=gatlbWFpbF9jbGlja9oAJDA0ODlhZGJjLWQ0YzYtNDJmOC04MDFiLTZiMWU1OWEwOWEwYw.- and talked about Convolutional Neural Networks for NLP.j) A public meeting is planned for April 24th in Seattle -.https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Seattle.k) MXNet 1.2 release is in preparation and release notes are being reviewed at.https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/%5BWIP%5D+Apache+MXNet+%28incubating%29+1.2.0+Release+Notes.l) Community voted and adopted Jira for issue management -.https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues/MXNET-267?filter=allopenissues.m) Established MXNet youtube channel -.https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQua2ZAkbr_Shsgfk1LCy6A.

Documentation- Architecture guides, How To's, Tutorials, and APIs continue.to be improved.d. More advanced features (e.g. ONNX support, mixed precission modeling, Scala.inference API, MKL-DNN integratino etc) and bug-fixes requested by the user.community continue to be added.How would you assess the podling's maturity?. Podling is still being established in Apache - hence maturity == Low. Initial setup. Working towards first release. Community building. Nearing graduation.
