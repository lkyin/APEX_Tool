Blur is a search platform capable of searching massive amounts of data. in a cloud computing environment.Blur has been incubating since 2012-07-24.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Official IP sign off. - Near Infinity signed CCLA and Blur Software Grant in July of 2012. - All committers have submitted ICLA's in July/August of 2012. - So I believe that an official vote is all that is needed. 2. First Apache release which is dependent on #1. - The biggest reason this has been delayed is due to several major code refactors to make use of Blur faster and easier. 3. Community growth, Blur needs to grow beyond the initial set of committors.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of? . No.How has the community developed since the last report?. - Overall message traffic was down through the holidays, but has started to pick back up since the beginning of the year. - Subscriptions: users@ - 31[+9]; dev@ - 33[+9].How has the project developed since the last report?. - There has been about 80 commits since the last report, from 2 committors and 1 contributor. - The 0.2 development branch is now functioning and is getting closer to feature parity with 0.1.Please check this when you have filled in the report for Blur.Signed-off-by:.Doug Cutting: (blurPatrick Hunt: (blurTim Williams: (blur.Shepherd notes: Cool project.
