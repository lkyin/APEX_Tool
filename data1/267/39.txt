That issue should not have been in the last report.Issues before graduation :. The biggest obstacle for graduation is obtaining a diverse group of active. committers. 95% of the commits over the past 6 months were by a single. committer. The project needs to engage the committers that exist and. identify new people to bring into the project. The goal for the next. quarter is to elicit more activity. .Signed off by mentor: rfrovarp, thorsten.
