{"project_name": "DataSketches", "alias": "datasketches", "description": "DataSketches is an open source, high-performance library of stochastic streaming algorithms commonly called \"sketches\" in the data sciences. Sketches are small, stateful programs that process massive data as a stream and can provide approximate answers, with mathematical guarantees, to computationally difficult queries orders-of-magnitude faster than traditional, exact methods.", "sponsor": "Incubator  (Jean-Baptiste Onofr\u00e9)", "mentor": "Liang Chen, Kenneth Knowles, Furkan Kamaci, Evans Ye, Dave Fisher", "start_date": "2019-03-30", "end_date": "2020-12-16", "status": "Graduated", "incubation_time": "20"}
