Annotator provides annotation enabling code for browsers, servers, and humans.Annotator has been incubating since 2016-08-30.Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:.Release initial versions.Add active contributors.Demonstrate good governance through voting on process improvements.Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?.Not at this time.How has the community developed since the last report?.We have had increased mentor activity and increased participation on our weekly calls which have both helped improve our momentum.How has the project developed since the last report?.We walked through the process of cutting a release (0.1.0) and putting that release up for a vote. The first vote attempt failed due to a process mistake we sent it to general@ before we passed it to dev@. We then attempted a second vote which passed at the project level, but failed when sent to the Incubator list. However, we received valuable feedback from Justin Mclean which we are now acting upon. We plan to attempt another release and vote early this month.How would you assess the podling's maturity?.Please feel free to add your own commentary. Initial setup. Working towards first release. Community building.Date of last release:.None yet (due to issues with release process and/or voting), but hopefully early this month.When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?.No new committers nor PPMC members have been added since the last report.Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?.Nick Kew has been more involved over email and has also been in attendance to at least one of the weekly community calls. We have greatly appreciated the involvement and look forward to more!.Signed-off-by:. (annotator) Nick Kew.Comments:.IPMC/Shepherd notes:.
