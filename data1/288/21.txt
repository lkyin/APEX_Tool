Hold an informal graduation readiness vote.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.No.How has the community developed since the last report?.No new committers added. .We stalled in our 0.6 release plans when our Release Manager left due to changing work commitments. A new Release Manager stepped forward and we're currently voting on a new Release Candidate.There has also been some discussion of whether we will ever become large enough to sustain a TLP, and whether it would make more sense to move the code into an existing TLP, e.g., OpenOffice or POI, both of which are related technologies. .How has the project developed since the last report?.Completed development work for 0.6 release. Along with the usual bug fixes, enhancements in this release include:. Added document encryption support. Added metadata support. Support for OpenDocument-v1.2. Additional APIs for Simple API.Please check this when you have filled in the report for ODF Toolkit.Signed-off-by:.Sam Ruby: (odftoolkitNick Burch: (odftoolkitYegor Kozlov: (odftoolkit.Shepherd notes:.
