Harmony project has moved out of it's initial phase in which it formalized contribution and other governance issues and has now accepted two major class library code contributions, one from IBM and one from Intel Work continues on those two codebases, with topics ranging from bug fixing, enhancements, as well as other topics such as how to organize test framework and documentation.Two releases of snapshots are imminent, one of a basic VM implementation (JCHEVM) and one of the current classlibrary. We are doing this to make it easier for users to work with the software.Our focus in the upcoming quarter is to continue our emphasis on community building through adding new committers and expaning the scope of our activities to include other kinds of committers (test, documentation, qa.) and continue to solicit donations to our codebase as well.
