Tez is a framework for processing arbitrarily complex data-processing tasks.Tez has been incubating since 2013-02-24.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Develop collaborations with other Apache projects, including Hadoop, YARN. 2. Make an initial Tez release. 3. Grow the Apache Tez community.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.None at this time.How has the community developed since the last report?.The community is still bootstrapping and we will need to probably finish getting ICLAs on board. Chris started a thread on dev@tez to request clarification on who needs ICLAs filed, and who needs accounts set up. Chris can help with this as can the other mentors.How has the project developed since the last report?.Arun checked in the initial code drop on March 15, 2013 at http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/incubator/tez/trunk/.Mailing lists for dev, private, and commits are up and running.Please check this when you have filled in the report for Tez.Signed-off-by:.Alan Gates: (tezArun C Murthy: (tezChris Douglas: (tezChris Mattmann: (tezJakob Homan: (tezOwen O'Malley: (tez.Shepherd notes:.
