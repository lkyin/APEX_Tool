Apache PhotArk will be a complete open source photo gallery application including a content repository for the images, a display piece, an access control layer, and upload capabilities. PhotArk was accepted for Incubation on August 19, 2008. Issues before graduation :. PhotArk started as a project with no initial code-base, and we have grown the community to the minimal 3 independent committer size required for graduation and have been seeing slow but continuous interest in the project. The community started discussion graduation and based on mentors feedback we are going to recruit couple committers before we start the graduation process. PhotArk released the M3 release which incorporates GSoC contributions. PhotArk is finalizing a Roadmap discussion that will drive development for most of the rest of the year. Various new contributors are coming to the mailing list and starting to pick Roadmap items to work thanks for Suho which did a good job advertising the project in a GSoC meetup in his university.Signed off by mentor: lresende.
