iPMC Reviewers: jukkaThe WSRP4J Project is an implementation of WSRP 1.0 Producer. WSRP is an OASIS specification that describes a protocol which allows portlets to be accessed remotely using Web Services.Incubating since: 2003.The project is very silent, there are nearly no user questions and nearly zero developer activity. Although there seems to be a medium to high interest in wsrp over the past years, no community could be built around wsrp4j. There is still an open patent issue. The portals PMC is aware of these problems and will address them asap.iPMC Comments:.jukka: Good that someone is looking into this.
