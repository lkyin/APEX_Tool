Moving github repos under the Apache Github Org (organization move,. repository renames), first 2 repos. moved; issues identified and being. worked. 2. Working to redirect openwhisk.incubator.apache.org to openwhisk.org,. update openwhisk.org to be Apache compliant (pre-req is repo. move. completion so that we can generate site via Jenkins/Apache tooling 3. Working through project incubation checklists on CWIKI. Compliance Checklist for OpenWhisk.org website.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. - Travis CI takes hours to process a PR on Apache Org; whereas it takes. minutes under current OpenWhisk org. - The root cause is that Apache has 185 repos enable with Travis[1], but. only an allocation of 30 concurrent builds. OpenWhisk typically needs 5. concurrent build slots by itself continually. - Many of the OpenWhisk’s repos. have cross-build dependencies (primarily. for Travis CI tests) this may will cause issues as repos. are brought. over 1 at a time if forwarding links are not preserved by GitHub. - There may be issues with Committers in China being able. to enable 2FA since it does not work with their cell phones and the. alternative encryption tool seems to be blocked.
