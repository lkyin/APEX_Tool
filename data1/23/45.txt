Milagro is core security infrastructure and crypto libraries for decentralized networks and distributed systems.Milagro has been incubating since 2015-12-21.Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:.Continue to build relevant and useful crypto libs and applications for decentralized networks in order to grow the ecosystem of users and contributors to the project.Continue to improve compliance with the Apache Way.Further releases to both extend the capability of the crypto libraries and D-TA, and to demonstrate improved compliance with the Apache Way.Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?.Please see the comment re: mentors below.How has the community developed since the last report?.No new members.How has the project developed since the last report?.Milagro’s first ASF release, the crypto-c and crypto-js libraries, was successful. These are modern cryptographic libraries that focus on Elliptic Curve Cryptography. The libraries include support for pairing-based cryptography such as BLS for short signatures and MPIN for multi-factor authentication.Issue tracking for individual repos has now been implemented in GitHub (Jira may still to be used for high-level planning) and redundant GitHub repos have been archived.Decentralized Trust Authority (D-TA) server code has been donated by a team lead by Howard Kitto at Qredo & IP clearance forms completed. Milagro’s vision is for the D-TA to be a general-purpose key generation, distribution and storage server with an initial focus on a) generating type-3 pairing/identity-based secrets for MPIN zero-knowledge & multi-factor authentication clients and servers, and, b) safeguard shares of secrets such as Bitcoin private keys.An attempt to release early alpha version of the D-TA failed the Apache Way but efforts to correct this are underway and we hope to have a successful ASF release shortly followed in quick succession by enhanced versions ultimately leading to a production-ready version early next year.Website (http://milagro.apache.org/users.html) updated with crypto-c, crypto-js and D-TA documentation.How would you assess the podling's maturity?. Initial setup. Working towards first release. Community building.Date of last release:.2019-08-27.When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?.June 2019.Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?.Our mentors haven’t been able to commit as much time to the project as they or us would like, but progress is still being made.Signed-off-by:.
