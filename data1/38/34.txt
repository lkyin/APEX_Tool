Apache Spot is a platform for network telemetry built on an open data model and Apache Hadoop.Spot has been incubating since 2016-09-23.Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:.Revive community activity (Discussion in mailing lists, increase frequency of commitsCreate a new roadmap and release plan that will improve adoption.Make it easier to contribute to the project (e.g. documentation, framework.Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?.No.How has the community developed since the last report?.Unfortunately there has not been much more community activity. However, we are need of more committers as there are only a couple of active committers at this time. This creates a bottleneck which makes it hard for the community to grow in interest.How has the project developed since the last report?.There are a series of PRs that have been evaluated for the SPOT-181 epic, and Spot website branch (asf-site) that are in the process of being merged. We have enough votes to merge, and have put out a request to committers to review so they can be auto-merged if possible, otherwise we will just manually merge them via cli.Once those are merged, we will work on the plan to merge SPOT-181 into master so that the Open Data Model is consolidated into the main branch of our code.We're also working on re-focusing the project release roadmap. Our first step will be to re-engage with the community to better understand how/where Spot is being used today, what features/enhancements would benefit the community best, and which committers (existing and potential) are interested in contributing to the roadmap and releases moving forward.How would you assess the podling's maturity?.Please feel free to add your own commentary.
