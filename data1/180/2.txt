We've just heard from Matt who's a release manager for Apache Geronimo 11.1 that the last reason to keep OpenEJB at Codehaus had been cleared and we're ready to move JIRA and repos to ASF.Three new people have showed their interest in the code and started to contribute - Mohammed Nour, Rick Mc{{`Guire and Jay D. Mc}}`Hugh.SVN as successfully been moved from Codehaus to Apache.Jira migration is being coordinated. This will be a migration to a new instance in ASF similar to Cayenne. However, we'd really like to run in the main instance. To facilitate this, work on a Jira migration tool is also underway. We hope that this will be useful to other projects migrating or whom have migrated.
