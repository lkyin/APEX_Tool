Apache DeviceMap is a data repository containing device information, images.and other relevant information for all sorts of mobile devices, e.g.smartphones and tablets.Entered incubation on January 3rd, 2012.There are no issues that require the Incubator PMC's or the board's attention.Little has happened since our last report in April, a prototype of client-side.device probes has been created [1], a few messages have been exchanged about.that but that's all.At this point the future of the project is unclear, we should re-evaluate the.situation for the next report in October to see if activity has picked up.[1] http://markmail.org/message/3bd63yqmuixn6co6.Signed off by mentor: bdelacretaz, kevan.Shepherd: Matt Hogstrom.
