iPMC Reviewers: jimTika is a toolkit for detecting and extracting metadata and structured text content from various document formats using existing parser libraries. Tika entered incubation on March 22nd, 2007.Community:.The Tika mailing list has seen increased activity in the last weeks, with some new people showing interest for Tika's goals.Grant Ingersoll brought the Aperture framework to our attention (http://aperture.sourceforge.net/), which has similar goals to Tika. We will look at possible synergies.Development:.No code has been committed since our last report, but some initial code is ready in JIRA and should be committed soon.Issues before graduation:.No changes since our last report: the Tika project is still at an early stage of incubation. We need to continue bringing in the initial codebases and probably target for an initial incubating release later this year. We also need to work on growing the community and figuring out how to best interact with external parser projects.
