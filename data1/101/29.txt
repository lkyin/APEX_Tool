Apache Empire-db is a relational database abstraction layer that allows developers to take a more SQL-centric approach in application development than traditional ORM frameworks. Its focus is to allow highly efficient database operations in combination with a maximum of compile-time-safety and DBMS independence.Project development since the last report.Last December we have finished and published release 2.0.7 that features some minor improvements and bug fixes. Currently we are working on release 2.1.0 with more significant improvements.Issues to address in the move towards graduation and community development.After now being 2 and a half years in the incubator we have managed to successfully implement and establish the Apache development and release cycle, we have published several releases and we have received good feedback from users who are subscribed to the dev and user lists.However during all this time, we have still not managed to get ourselves known to a wider audience and to get a significant amount of public attention, most certainly due to the fact that have not managed to work on publicity as much as on code. Also our community currently consists of only 3 active committers that are regularly contributing to the project.For this reason questions about the future of the project and whether we will ever be able to graduate have been raised. While the remaining active committers are determined to continue their project commitment and to work towards graduation it is still unclear by which measures new committers can be won to join the project.Hence, for the coming months answering this question and establishing the corresponding measures should be our focus. One way of answering this question could be to move this discussion to the dev list in order to find out how our subscribers feel about the status of the project. Also it might make sense to combine the user and dev lists in order to prevent subscribers from missing information and getting them more involved in the project.Signed off by mentor: dashorst.
