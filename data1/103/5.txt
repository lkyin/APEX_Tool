Etch was accepted into Incubator on 2 September 2008.Etch is a cross-platform, language- and transport-independent framework for building and consuming network services. The Etch toolset includes a network service description language, a compiler, and binding libraries for a variety of programming languages.We've prepared a bug fix release (1.0.2) which has been submitted for an incubator vote. The 1.0.2 release also includes updated licensing information in compliance with Apache standards. A 1.1 release with proper package and namespace changes is being prepared as well. The 1.1 release will also include experimental code for a c and python binding.Our problem with finding a home for our continuous build continues. Various plans have been proposed and failed due to lack of a Windows-friendly c# build environment. While we will continue for awhile to host this build at Cisco, we need to find a more neutral and open place to do public builds.Cisco folks continue to be the primary source of discussion and commits. There are some external nibbles, but none that are ready to pitch-in in a serious way yet. More work needs to be done on the web site to make steps to participation more evident. Work also needs to be done on the build environment to make it a bit more forgiving.Outstanding items:.Check and make sure that the papers that transfer rights to the ASF been received.Check and make sure that the files that have been donated have been updated to reflect the new ASF copyright.Check and make sure that for all code included with the distribution that is not under the Apache license.Check and make sure that all source code distributed by the project is covered by one or more of the following approved licenses.
