iPMC Reviewers: robertburrelldonkin, mvdbThe Heraldry podling has been terminated by consensus of the remaining committers and by vote by the Incubator PMC. Essentially, the community was never able to reboot after the earlier breakdown. The committers are currently discussing what code will be forked to RubyForge, Google Code or other repositories. All in all, the decision to terminate was not controversial and came from the committers themselves. The mentors and PMC will finalize the closure of the project resources within the next month.
