The last quarter has seen the creation of the WebWork 2 podling and rapid progress Our focus has been on migrating code, resources, developers, IP, and community over to the ASF.Code: we have imported the code into the Incubator SVN, and have renamed packages, taglib prefixes, and any other references to the old WebWork project over to the new Struts Action Framework 2 project, where the final location of the code will be.Resources: We've migrated the code to the Apache SVN, setup and migrated JIRA tickets to the new issues.apache.org server, and are in the process of migration wiki documentation.Developers: The core WebWork 2 developers have been given accounts and access to the podling, voted in through the proposal. We plan to vote the remaining committers in one-by-one through the Struts PMC, serving as the IPMC for the podling.IP: The OpenSymphony organization, who owns the copyright on the WebWork 2 project, has delivered a code grant allowing us to change the copyright. Additionally, we've removed most of the LGPL source code (usually in the form of Javascript libraries) and have developed an optional build that compiles integration code depending on LGPL jars, in accordance to the draft IP policy document.Community: The WebWork 2 developers have joined the Struts mailing lists and have been very active in participating with both development and user threads. They have been just as, if not more, active committing to the code repository as Struts committers, and when conflicts arise, they are very quick to come to a solution in a positive way. In addition, several Struts committers have joined OpenSymphony forums, chat rooms, and projects further strengthening the relationship.We are definitely planning on exiting the Incubator this next quarter, possibly within weeks. We see a bright future for the Struts Action project, and hope to facilitate a new spirit of cooperation within the competitive landscape of Java web application frameworks.
