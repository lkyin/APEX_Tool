Celix is an implementation of the OSGi Specification in C.Celix entered incubation on November 2, 2010.In the code not much has changed during the past few months, mostly due to vacations. Some (reported) bugs have been fixed, and some interesting examples have been added. These example where donated by a user, and follow the OSGi in Action book. This makes them a great addition to Celix.Furthermore, some work has been done to make testing from CMake easier, and we are also looking into a method for mocking services to be able to test only one service without all its dependencies.On the community site, Luminis and Thales are organizing an event (in Dutch) to introduce embedded/distributed companies to OSGi. During this event OSGi will be explained, Celix and PojoSR will be introduced. Also a small introduction in Apache and the "Apache Way" will be given, with the goal to invite people to use/join Celix.Also, in november a talk and demo will be given at the ApacheCon.Most important issues are:. Improve robustness (APR, error handling etc Generate awareness and grow a community!.Signed off by mentor: marrs.
