Apache OGNL is a Java development framework for Object-Graph.Navigation Language, plus other extras such as list projection and.selection and lambda expressions.The project just joined the Incubator on April 26, 2011. A list of the three most important issues to address in the move.towards graduation. - make at least a big release that shows to Commons PMC the.compliancy level of OGNL to Commons policies;. - attract more users, at the moment only Apache Struts people are.interested because they heavily use OGNL;. - attract more new committers, the only external contribution we got.was about the new OGNL logo. Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of. - no news about Marc Andrew Davidson's even if was requested twice;. - not every PPMC member joined the private ML yet;. - due to OpenSymphony dismissing, we need importing old issues to.ASF jira. We've been trying to contact someone from OpenSymphony to.obtain an OGNL Issue dump/XML backup. How has the community developed since the last report.Community is healthy and people participate to discussions, getting a.lot of suggestions from Commons PMCs, few members are very active, no.new committers yet. How has the project developed since the last report.Codebase has been imported and committers started updating it.according to Apache Commons policies. Site is online and we got a new.logo.We also have Jenkins and Sonar jobs.Signed off by mentor: Olivier Lamy.
