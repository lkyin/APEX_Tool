Project Name - Apache CXF.Description - SOA enabling framework, web services toolkit.Date of Entry - August 2006.Items to resolve before graduation:.Finalize/cleanup the PPMC and committer list to reflect actual participation. We'll be starting those discussions and stuff shortly with hopes to start graduation discussions shortly there after. Dan Kulp had a "face to face" chat with Jim Jagielski at ApacheCon about how to proceed with this.Community aspects:.Worked with Geronimo and Yoko projects to break Yoko into parts bringing the webservices stuff into CXF. Initial bits of code have been "svn cp" into CXF.Started discussions with Dain (and OpenEJB) about adding soap encoding and JAX-RPC support into CXF. Work on that has started with contributions from Dain.Lots of traffic on the cxf-user list. That's a good thing. Some of them are digging into CXF code and submitting patches and suggestions. That's an even better thing. We need to find ways to get more of that.Code aspects:.Released 2.0.3-incubator fixing over 70 issues found by users.Preparing 2.0.4-incubator to be released soon fixing another 50+ issues.2.1 work is progressing well.
