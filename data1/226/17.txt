SystemML provides declarative large-scale machine learning (ML) that aims at.flexible specification of ML algorithms and automatic generation of hybrid.runtime plans ranging from single node, in-memory computations, to distributed.computations such as Apache Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark.SystemML has been incubating since 2015-11-02.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Grow SystemML community: increase mailing list activity,. increase adoption of SystemML for scalable machine learning, encourage data. scientists to adopt DML algorithm scripts, respond to user feedback to. ensure SystemML meets the requirements of real-world situations, and present. talks about SystemML. 2.
