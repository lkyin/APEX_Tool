The main issue at the moment continues to be the gathering of iCLAs We're making progress:.Total number of contributors contacted: 104.Number of contributors with iCLA already filed at ASF: 41.Number of contributors that have already sent their iCLA, but still not filed at ASF: 18.Number of contributors who have not yet sent their iCLA: 45.We will begin discussing alternative strategies, such as clean-room re-implementations, for code whose contributors have not sent in their CLAs yet.We've made some significant progress in replacing LGPL jars, mainly JOTM, the default transaction manager of OFBiz. We've integrated the Geronimo/Jencks transaction manager (TM) into OFBiz, and early testing shows it's working fine. We continue testing and gathering feedback, and anticipate that we will be able to remove the JOTM jars soon. At the same time, we will be able to remove some other, less critical, LGPLed jars. Once that's done, we plan to move the OFBiz codebase to the Incubator SVN server.A new committer has been added to the project (Jacques Le Roux): he is a longtime contributor and is doing some interesting implementation for the POS (Point of Sale) component, so the core group of initial committers has (succesfully) voted to grant him commit rights to the POS component.
