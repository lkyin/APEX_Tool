Metron integrates a variety of open source big data technologies in order to.offer a centralized tool for security monitoring and analysis. Metron.provides capabilities for log aggregation, full packet capture indexing,.storage, advanced behavioral analytics and data enrichment, while applying.the most current threat-intelligence information to security telemetry.within a single platform.Metron has been incubating since 2015-12-06.Three most important issues to address in the move towards.Graduation. - Building a diverse community of developers for Metron. - Getting security practitioners to provide feedback on requirements. - Make an Apache release.Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to.be aware of. - We are currently trying to produce the first Apache release of Metron. How has the community developed since the last report. - We added one additional committer, David Lyle. - We accepted 2 separate contributions from non-committers interested. in Metron. - We saw an uptick in interest from the community on the dev boards which. corresponds to people trying the product prior to an official release,. which is a good sign. How has the project developed since the last report. - We closed 20 more Jiras and are in the latest stages of releasing an. Apache release. - We added deployment automation for EC2 so trying out Metron in a. multi-node environment is even easier. - We integrated the CI environment that infra set up for us at our request. so that unit tests and apache rat license checks are run on every pull. request submitted. - We added support for indexing enriched sensor capture data into Apache. Solr indexing as well as Elasticsearch.Date of last release:. -- .When were the last committers or PMC members elected?. David Lyle on 22 March 2016.Signed-off-by:. (metron) Billie Rinaldi.
