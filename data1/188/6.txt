Apache PDFBox is an open source Java library for working with PDF documents PDFBox entered incubation on February 7th, 2008.We have finally migrated all sources to Apache svn and set up the project website at http://incubator.apache.org/pdfbox/. We also set up a CI build using Hudson. Traffic is picking up on the user and developer mailing lists, new issues are being reported through Jira, and there is initial discussion about an incubating 0.8.0 release.Software Grants have been received from Ben Litchfield and Daniel Wilson who are the primary authors of the PDFBox, FontBox and JempBox software. There have been a lot of small contributions (under the BSD license) by a number of other people to the project and it was asked (see http://markmail.org/message/zy6oweihmenqt6o4) on the legal-discuss list whether the primary authors have "sufficient rights" to grant a license for all of the code, or if we have to contact all the other contributors for separate grants. Having received no response to the question on legal-discuss we assumed that software grants from the primary authors was sufficient.We're discussing about what to do with the FontBox and JempBox codebases that are included as subprojects of PDFBox. We might decide to merge them with similar efforts in other Apache projects, most notably XML Graphics.Issues before graduation:.Increase community size and activity.License review.Export control notifications.First Apache release.
