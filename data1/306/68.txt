A wave is a hosted, live, concurrent data structure for rich communication.It can be used like email, chat, or a document.Wave has been incubating since 2010-12-04.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Growing community. 2. Improving code base.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. None.How has the community developed since the last report?. - We have ongoing community discussion about how to bring in new developers. to ensure sustainability of the project. A votation session has been scheduled (Sept 28th) to decide if Wave's fork. Swellrt is brought/merged into Wave. This would bring SwellRT active. developers into Wave and it could facilitate use of Wave by new developers. thanks to a new API, removing GWT legacy code.How has the project developed since the last report?. - Made some code improvements.Date of last release:. March 2016.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?. February 2016.Signed-off-by:. (wave) Christian Grobmeier. (wave) Upayavira.Shepherd/Mentor notes:. Upayavira:. Once more Wave is on the brink of retirement. However, this time, an. offer has been made of code from SwellRT, which is a fork of Wave itself,. and a concall has been scheduled for interested parties to discuss. whether it is a go-er. It is my (limited) understanding that many of the. complexity issues in the Wave code that have prevented community. development have been resolved in SwellRT. I will watch to see where this. goes, if anywhere.
