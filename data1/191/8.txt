Pivot is an open-source platform for building rich internet applications in Java It has been in incubation since January 2009.Pivot 1.3 was released in September. This was a major feature release and included a number of new features, bug fixes, and other enhancements.A new Pivot tutorial highlighting a number of features included in Pivot 1.3 was published on IBM developerWorks:.http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/tutorials/x-pivottut/index.html.The team is actively working on version 1.4. Pivot 1.4 is primarily a documentation and bug fix release, though some new features will also be included.Top 3 issues prior to graduation:.The Incubator PMC voted on a graduation proposal in September. The proposal technically passed, but only by a very slim margin. As a result, Pivot PPMC elected to cancel the vote and focus on the issues raised by those who voted -1, in hopes that a more unanimous approval might be obtained later.The primary concern was that the project had not yet established sufficient community and was still largely driven by two of the initial committers. Since that time, there has been a significant increase in activity from the other committers, and the project has received several patches from outside contributors. One such patch, an improvement to table column resizing, was committed to the platform. The developer responsible for the patch demonstrated very strong knowledge of the platform and would be considered for addition as a committer should the quality of his code submissions continue to be high.The team hopes to present a renewed graduation proposal early next year, to coincide with the release of Pivot 1.4.Signed off by mentor: Niclas Hedhman.IPMC comments:.Jukka Zitting: Sign-off from me too. I've been watching Pivot since the first graduation vote attempt, and can confirm the positive development since then. +1 to a new graduation proposal as soon as the community feels ready to do it.
