Incubating since 2010-10-03.Description. Kitty is a command line JMX Client written in Groovy. It is a lightweight, production focused, application server performance diagnostic and management utility.The three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1) The community around this project is absent, looking at the amount of mails sent to the mailing list in the past months. 2) The lack of a "Product Owner" who can prioritise stories/tasks, leaving the developers without a clue about the functionalities to implement. 3) The code is a port from another language (Jython), and the history of the past project seems lost, so there isn't any reference about how the actual code should work. Also, there is no test (acceptance criteria) in support of that nor for the new features to implement.Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of?. What seems relevant to me at the moment is the lack of communication between the committers;. it would be fine if there was a clear statement about who is still interested and who is not in participating in the project, and how to reorganise the now shrunken team, if still there is one.How has the community developed since the last report?. Sadly, the community hasn't develop at all; even worse, we faced the loss of some members who were actively involved in the project development/management.How has the project developed since the last report?. Jira is not updated, leaving a shade of uncertainty about what has been fixed and what is still in progress since the last report. It seems that the last update was done in October, the 4th, with a fix regarding the correct navigation through the server tree in a file-system fashion.Signed off by mentor: kevan, jim.
