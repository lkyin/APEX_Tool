At least one Any23 incubating release.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC), Tika PMC, or ASF Board wish/need.to be aware of?. Good news -- Michele Mostarda and Simone Tripodi and Lewis John McGibbney. and others stepped it up and got the code migrated from Google Code over. here to Apache. Thanks guys!.How has the community developed since the last report?. Since the code move from Google Code here to Apache, development traffic. has picked up. No new committers yet though, so we'll need to watch this. going forward.How has the project developed since the last report?. Any23 was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on October 1, 2011. We still need to discuss Paolo Castagna's points regarding the integration. of more of the 'semantic web' projects which exist at Apache. Also, a number. of uses of the project are being realized as Lewis John McGibbney is trying. to figure out a Nutch plugin. Simone Tripodi did a great job of getting our. website up and running. So now we have an Incubator website! And the rest. of the team is starting to discuss on list more. very happy about that!. All in all, everything is going well.Signed off by mentor: mattmann.
