Comments:. (batchee) Mark Struberg. Comments: I think we should graduate indeed. . It seems we had some confusion with the LDAP when we added rsandtner as committer. . We need to scan our mailing lists and check what is missing on the official status page.IPMC/Shepherd notes:.team-list.html - this page shows no members or committers.I checked private and it looks like the last committer/ppmc add was in Dec 2015.User ML had questions from only one person at two different times in 2015.There is activity and it looks like a new release may happen soon.Dave Fisher.
