Slider is a collection of tools and technologies to package, deploy, and.manage long running applications on Apache Hadoop YARN clusters.Slider has been incubating since 2014-04-29.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Podling name search. 2. Growing user community. 3. Growing and increasing diversity of developer community.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. None.How has the community developed since the last report?. We're only getting started, and do not have any diversity yet. Our first. goal will be to get users, bug reporters and developers. The dev list is. up and running -and we do not have any separate user list, so we hope to. pull users into coding. The initial release will help to gain awareness, and should bring in. users.How has the project developed since the last report?. Our main activity has been setting up the incubator-hosted project, JIRA,. site, mailing list. etc. The Infra team have been very helpful here. - Making and publishing our site has educated us on site publishing. - The initial release has taught us of the release process for incubating. projects, and where we need to improve it. We're still trying to get Jenkins building, but that's a matter of. handling protobuf-versions on the build machines, rather than infra. involvement. We have made our first ASF-hosted release on June 2. This was a source. only release; some of the reviewers have made suggestions which will need. to be incorporated into the next. We plan to do another release in a few. weeks time, and so evolve the project rapidly.Date of last release:. 2014-06-02.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?.We have only just set up and so the committer and PMC membership is.as covered in the incubator proposal.Signed-off-by:.
