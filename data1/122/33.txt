Nothing at this time.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware.of?. Nothing urgent at this time.How has the community developed since the last report?.1. Conference Talks :. HAWQ for data scientists, Shanghai CIO forum (Speaker: Lei Chang, June .23, 2018 .2. "Graduate Apache HAWQ (incubating) as a TLP" discussion was started: .https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/67a2d52ef29cbf9e93d8050ed0193cc110a91996.2dd92f8436b343b7@%3Cdev.hawq.apache.org%3E.The followings is the content of the thread:.With the 2.3.0.0-incubating release officially out, the Apache HAWQ.community and its mentors believe it is time to consider graduation to the.TLP:.https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/b4a0b5671ce377b3d51c9b7.ab00496a1eebfcbf1696ce8b67e078c64@%3Cdev.hawq.apache.org%3E.Apache HAWQ entered incubation in September of 2015, since then, the HAWQ.community learned a lot about how to do things in Apache ways. Now we have.a healthy and engaged community, ready to help with all questions from the.HAWQ community. We delivered four releases including two binary releases,.now we can do self-driving releases in good cadence. The PPMC has.demonstrated a good understanding of growing the community by electing 12.individuals as committers and PPMC members. The PPMC addressed the maturity.issues one by one followed by Apache Project Maturity Model, currently all.the License and IP issues are resolved. This demonstrated our understanding.of ASF's IP policies.All in all, I believe this project is qualified as a true TLP and we should.recognize this fact by formally awarding it such a status. This thread.means to open up the very same discussion that we had among the mentors and.HAWQ community to the rest of the IPMC.
