None at this time.How has the community developed since the last report:. Plan to release version 0.6 to fix some of the major bugs in version 0.5.How has the project developed since the last report:. Prior to Hadoop summit, there was a thread discussion of retiring Chukwa. because there does not seem to be much activity in the community. All PPMC. members seem to agree to this idea. There were some free advertisement for. Chukwa in Hadoop summit from word of mouth and speakers mentioned Chukwa in. their talks. There seems to be some contribution activities happening. after Hadoop summit. Discussion continued for retiring Chukwa because. mentor does not think a community is developing. We plan to open enrollment. for Chukwa committers for people who are interested to continue development. for the next quarter. If activities generate a active community, then we. will apply for becoming top level project. If no activities happen, then. we will retire Chukwa.Signed off by mentor:.Shepherd: Benson Margulies.
