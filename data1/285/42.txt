MRQL is a query processing and optimization system for large-scale,.distributed data analysis, built on top of Apache Hadoop, Hama, Spark, and.Flink.MRQL has been incubating since 2013-03-13.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Increase the number of active committers. 2. Increase adoption, expand user community, and increase user list activity.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware.of?.No.How has the community developed since the last report?.There were no new developers or new committers since our last report.How has the project developed since the last report?.There were 8 JIRA issues reported during this period, from which 7 have.already been resolved. The main work during this period was on algebra-based.and source-level debugging of MRQL queries. Basically, results from an MRQL.query are annotated with lineage information, which links each result value.with the input data that were used to calculate the value. Given a result.value, our debugger not only can print the input values that contributed to.the result value, but can also display the detailed workflow that was used to.calculate this value (how-to provenance In contrast other data-centric.debuggers, such as Titian for Spark, our debugger supports on-line browsing.and searching using GUIs and can work on all MRQL supported platforms.(map-reduce, Spark, Flink, and Hama It also allows to insert trace points in.the query source to debug the query at the source level. We hope that this.debugger will be a valuable tool for developing and understanding MRQL.queries.Date of last release:. 2016-03-02.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?. 2014-04-17.Signed-off-by:.
