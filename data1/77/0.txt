Apache Chemistry is an effort to provide a Java (and possibly others, like JavaScript) implementation of the upcoming CMIS specification Chemistry entered incubation on April 30th, 2009.The Chemistry project has just entered incubation and we've been busy getting started with everything. Most of the project infrastructure is already in place, all the CLAs have been received, and the initial codebases are now in Apache svn.Many Chemistry developers had a chance to meet in person in the CMIS PlugFest at the end of April, and the resulting energy has been visible also on the new Chemistry mailing lists. Among the results are updates to the core Chemistry codebase, a new JavaScript-based CMIS client codebase, and a proposal to contribute a Flex/Air -based CMIS explorer.Issues before graduation:.Stabilize the general interest and energy into a sustainable development community.Make sure that license headers and other details conform with Apache policies.Create an Apache release of the Chemistry codebase.
