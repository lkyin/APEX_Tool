Tez is an effort to develop a generic application framework which can be used.to process arbitrarily complex data-processing tasks and also a re-usable set.of data-processing primitives which can be used by other projects.Tez has been incubating since 2013-02-24.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Develop collaborations with other Apache projects, including Hadoop, YARN. 2. Make an initial Tez release. 3. Grow the Apache Tez community.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. None at this time.How has the community developed since the last report?. No new PPMC members or committers added since the last report. We need to. work to do a better job of identifying new contributors, but there is great. activity so I don't think this will be a big issue.How has the project developed since the last report?. 1. 170 jiras filed and 120 odd jiras resolved since the first week of June. 2013. 2. The first Tez meetup was held at the Hortonworks office on July 31st and. had an attendance of around 30+ users/developers from across the Hadoop. ecosystem community. 3. Seeing more adoption from the Hive community as well as some initial. prototyping work being done in Pig. 4. Looking to make a release in the next couple of months after the release. of hadoop-2.1.0-beta ( which Tez depends on . We are to looking to increase both the user base as well as get more. contributors by having more meetups and also expect a release to drive more. adoption of Tez.Signed-off-by: . (tez) Alan Gates.
