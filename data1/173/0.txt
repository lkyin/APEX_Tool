The OFBiz project has commenced incubation in a slow-but-steady way, as can be seen here: http://incubatorapache.org/projects/ofbiz.html Most of the infrastructure is set up and waiting to be transitioned, but the concensus seems to be to take things slowly. There are a fair number of people using the infrastructure, and making a mess of it for very long would create problems for users. All of the original committers bar Si Chen (who has sent his CLA in, and is waiting for it to be processed) have got their accounts. Work is ongoing to eliminate any LGPL code, although it appears there are some technical obstacles: http://lists.ofbiz.org/pipermail/dev/2006-March/010036.html (I'm not much of a Java guy, so anyone willing to help out there is welcome to have at it!) In terms of collecting CLA's, there is a lot of work to be done, but the OFBiz guys are chipping away at it: http://ofbizwiki.go-integral.com/Wiki.jsp?page=OFBizDevelopers For those interested in technical developments, Si Chen does a weekly roundup of interesting changes here: http://ofbiz-new.blogspot.com/.
