SocialSite is an open source Social Networking Service based on Apache Shindig (incubating) The software is not simply a "canned" Social Network or Facebook-in-a-box type of web application; it's something different. SocialSite is designed to add social networking features to existing web applications and web sites. SocialSite is made up of two parts: 1) a social data server that supports the OpenSocial APIs and extensions and 2) a set of OpenSocial gadgets that provide a complete user-interface for social networking.SocialSite is in the process of entering the incubator. Status page and SVN space have been created but no user accounts. Committers are sending in ICLAs and we're waiting on Sun to deliver the code grant.
