2009-October Tashi Incubator Status Report.Tashi has been incubating since September 2008.The Tashi project aims to build a software infrastructure for cloud computing on massive internet-scale datasets (what we call Big Data The idea is to build a cluster management system that enables the Big Data that are stored in a cluster/data center to be accessed, shared, manipulated, and computed on by remote users in a convenient, efficient, and safe manner.Development activities have included a communication layer rewrite, the introduction of an EC2 compatibility layer, a bridge that allows the use of Maui as a scheduler for Tashi, patches for HVM booting in Xen, DNS updates, using RPyC on Python 2.4, the SQL backend, the updateVm RPC, and the client utility's output, fixes to and an expansion of the VM statistics collection code in the Qemu backend. Additionally, a notes field was added to the host definition, a syslog handler was added for logging, the scheduler was modified to reduce the number of repeated messages, and the documentation for setting up a single machine and configuring DHCP and DNS servers was updated.The project is still working toward building a larger user and development community. We have recently been contacted by some potential users from Taiwan HP, as seen on the -dev list. Additionally, two developers have increased the quantity of patches submitted in this quarter, expanding the number of developers working on the project. The upcoming tutorial at SC'09 [1] is drawing near and we expect to draw in more potential users at the event.Items to be resolved before graduation:.Prepare and review a release candidate.Develop community diversity (currently Intel and CMU committers[1] http://scyourway.nacse.org/conference/view/tut168.Signed off by mentor:.
