MRQL is a query processing and optimization system for large-scale,.distributed data analysis, built on top of Apache Hadoop, Hama, Spark, and.Flink.MRQL has been incubating since 2013-03-13.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Increase the number of active committers. 2. Increase adoption, expand user community, and increase user list. activity.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. None.How has the community developed since the last report?. There were no new developers or new committers since our last report. There are 3 new UTA students who are planning to contribute to the MRQL. projects as part of their Master's thesis in Spring'16, but they have not. participated in the MRQL community yet. We hope to get more. contributions/committers from the Flink and Spark communities to help us. fine-tune the MRQL evaluation engine on these platforms.How has the project developed since the last report?. Very little activity on JIRA since the last report (only 2 issues reported. that were both fixed One of the JIRA issues was related to a major. extension to MRQL to support incremental query processing (to convert any. stream-based MRQL query to an incremental query that merges the previous. query results with the results of applying the query to the new data. batches only This was based on an idea presented at ApacheCon'15 as a. future plan for MRQL. It works on Spark Streaming mode for now, but it. will soon support Flink Streaming too.Date of last release:. 2015-02-25.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?. 2014-04-17.Signed-off-by:.
