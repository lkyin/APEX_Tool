Apache MXNet is a lean, flexible, and ultra-scalable deep learning framework .that supports state of the art in deep learning models, including .convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory networks .(LSTMs The framework has its roots in academia and came about through the .collaboration and contributions of researchers at several top universities. .It has been designed to excel at computer vision, speech, language .processing and understanding, generative models, concurrent neural networks, .and recurrent neural networks. MXNet allows you to define, train, and deploy .networks across a wide array of use cases from massive cloud infrastructure .to mobile and connected devices. It provides a very flexible environment .with support for many common languages and the ability to utilize both .imperative and symbolic programming constructs. MXNet also very lightweight. .This allows it to scale across multiple GPUs and multiple machines very .efficiently, which is beneficial when conducting training on large datasets .in the cloud. .Apache MXNet has been incubating since 23-Jan, 2017. .Four most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. .1.	Establish a predictable release process consistent with Apache Way .-- ESTABLISHED.2.	Grow the community -- ONGOING.3.	Bring website up to Apache standard COMPLETED.4.	Identify remaining ICLAs or SGAs that need signing NEAR COMPLETION.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware .of?. . None. .How has the community developed since the last report?. .a)	Various Slack channels, dev@ mailing lists, and user discussion .forums (http://discuss.mxnet.io) are being used actively. The contributors .have been working on having all discussions on the public dev@ mailing list .as much as possible. At least one of the discussions infringed on Apache .code of conduct and mentors had to step in and provide guidance to the .community. .b) After lengthy discussion the community agreed to establish .user@mxnet.incubator.apache.org with the goal to increase users as well as .grow the contributor community.c)	Community events: .- In April the community organized the first MXNet meetup in Seattle. We had .over 100 attendees, 15% from outside Amazon. .- In May the community organized a virtual hangout with two sessions to .collect feedback and ideas from the community.- Korean MXNet community is growing well and most of contributors are .outside of Amazon: .https://www.meetup.com/ko-KR/MXNet-Korea-User-Group/events/248531181/ .
