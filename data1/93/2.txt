Apache DeviceMap is a data repository containing device information, images.and other relevant information for all sorts of mobile devices, e.g.smartphones and tablets.Entered incubation on January 3rd, 2012.There are no issues that require the Incubator PMC's or the board's attention.The project is still slowly ramping up. We have started to flesh out our.website, created some initial prototypes for data collection of mobile.device data and setup a VM at http://devicemap-vm.apache.org/ to experiment.with those prototypes.Signed off by mentor: bdelacretaz, kevan.
