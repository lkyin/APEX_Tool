Project is moving along Recent quarter has focused on creating the contribution and committer process for the project. The result has been the creation of an "Authorized Contributor Questionnaire" to allow contributors to declare what portions of the project codebase they could have problems working in due to contraints imposed on them through prior work. (For example, being under NDA to an employer.) We also have worked out the process for accepting "bulk contributions", those works that have been created elsewhere and are being donated to Harmony. This process builds on the standard Apache Incubator process - a CCLA or SG is still required and registered.Other highlights :.We have accepted 3 new code contributions.Componentization proof of concept."bootVM" a new basic VM nucleus."JCHEVM", a re-licensing of JCVM.We have added two new committers.We expect to continue to add new committers and new code at an accelerating rate.
