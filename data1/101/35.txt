Apache Empire-db is a relational database abstraction layer that allows developers to take a more SQL-centric approach in application development than traditional ORM frameworks. Its focus is to allow highly efficient database operations in combination with a maximum of compile-time-safety and DBMS independence. Empire-db has entered Incubation in August 2008.After having published our 2.1.0 release in April, things went a bit slower during the last quarter. Recently our committers have fixed smaller issues and we have made the Empire-db code base available on git.We regularly receive user requests on our user list asking for help and or improvements. Some users submitted small patches through Jira.For the next term we have planned to start a major API improvement which might help making Empire-db attractive for even more users.In order to graduate we still need to increase awareness of the project through various channels in order to grow our community. This means participating in blogs and write our own articles. We will set up a discussion on how exactly our communication can be improved.Signed off by mentor:.
