MRQL is a query processing and optimization system for large-scale,.distributed data analysis, built on top of Apache Hadoop, Hama, Spark, and .Flink.MRQL has been incubating since 2013-03-13.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. increase the number of active committers. 2. increase adoption, expand user community, and increase user list . activity.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?.none.How has the community developed since the last report?.We have released our second release under Apache incubation. After we.added Apache Flink as an evaluation backend for MRQL, there was an.interest by the Flink community in our project, which may result in.collaboration between the projects and may expand our user community.How has the project developed since the last report?.We have added support for Apache Flink. Now users can run MRQL queries.on a Yarn cluster using 4 different backends (Hadoop map-reduce, Hama,.Spark, and Flink), without having to change their queries.Date of last release:. 2014-06-26.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?. 2014-04-17.Signed-off-by:.
