iPMC Reviewers: jukkaDescription - XAP is a client side declarative Ajax framework for building and deploying rich internet applications.Date of entry - June, 2006.The top three items to resolve in last report have seen very good progress:.Dojo 0.9 migration - XAP is currently using Dojo 0.4 as the default Ajax toolkit. Dojo 0.9 is a complete rewriet of Dojo. Though it is not compatible with Dojo 0.4, Dojo 0.9 seems to have fixed many problems of Dojo and is likely to become a solid foundation for future Ajax development. XAP developers are investigating whether/when/how to migrate to Dojo 0.9. 2. Release - XAP has made one release within the community so far (XAP 0.3 release on March 2007); 3. Growth of community - XAP community is growing, we see more and more contributions in many forms from people other than the initial committers: feedback on the mailing lists, documentation and code patches. The commuity has voted to add a new committer.Community aspects:.Contributions from various non-committers continued in areas such as bug reports, code patches, and discussions;.Vote of a new committer passed.Coach Wei gave a talk on Apache XAP and Declarative Ajax at AjaxWorld Conference in march 2007 at NYC;.We have reviewed the web site tracking and added mechanism to collect XAP download statistics.jQuery integration is done. XAP customers can leverage jQuery as well - plugin available both from jQuery website and XAP website(http://jquery.com/plugins/project/xModify.Code aspects:.Significant work went into xModify - now we have a 3KB engine (leverages jQuery) for declaratively "ajaxify" HTML web applications. Customers can get "Ajax" result without writing a single line of Javascript, by using the 3KB "xModify with jQuery" module.Web site has been updated.
