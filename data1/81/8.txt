CloudStack is an IaaS (“Infrastracture as a Service”) cloud orchestration platform.CloudStack has been incubating since 2012-04-16.A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation. 1. Continuing to build the community and increase diversity, while effectively managing the overall scale of the project. 2. Ensuring all deliberation, decision-making, and development is happening openly and collaboratively. 3. Transfer trademark, etc. to Apache.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?. No issues at this time.How has the community developed since the last report?. We have noticed a trend of features for CloudStack being developed outside of the Apache CloudStack community and "thrown over the wall." We are identifying features that may not have been developed appropriately and requiring contributors to either demonstrate that they have been discussed and developed in the open, or requiring IP clearance for those features. We have also opened discussion about this on the -dev mailing list and ensuring that committers understand the obligations to development in the open. The project has continuted to grow and has added several new PPMC members and committers since October:. - Edison Su, Alex Huang, Hugo Trippaers, Chiradeep Vittal, and Joe Brockmeier have joined the PPMC since October. - Rohit Yadav, Marcus Sorensen, Gavin Lee, Sudha Ponnaganti, Kelcey Damage, Min Chen, and Sebastien Goasguen have become committers. Members of the CloudStack community have been active in promoting the project since the last report, with members giving talks about Apache CloudStack at USENIX LISA, CPOSC, ApacheCon EU, LinuxCon EU, and other events. The CloudStack Collaboration Conference (sponsored primarily by Citrix) was a fairly successful first conference. More than 300 people attended the event, held November 30 - December 2 in Las Vegas at The Venetian.How has the project developed since the last report?. The first release, 4.0.0-incubating, was announced on November 6th. The CloudStack.org domain now points to Apache infrastructure. 4.0.1 and 4.1.0 are currently in development. The community has decided to work on a time-based release cycle for feature releases, with 4.1.0 expected at the beginning of April. Feature releases will follow a four-month cycle thereafter.Please check this when you have filled in the report for CloudStack.Signed-off-by:.Jim Jagielski: (cloudstackJ.
