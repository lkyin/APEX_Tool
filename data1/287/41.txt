NPanday allows projects using the .NET framework to be built with Apache.Maven.NPanday has been incubating since 2010-08-13.Since the last report in April, a few obstacles have been removed:. - the status page was updated with the current podling state and correct. mentors. - svnpubsub was enabled so the website can be updated again. - a number of JIRA issues have been cleaned up to prepare for the release.Not blocking, but outstanding things to do:. - resolve issues with Jenkins builds with infrastructure. - finish closing out JIRA issues that have been partially finished. for release. - apply suitable patches that have been overlooked in the past and try. to reconnect with contributors.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Ship the changes on trunk as a release and make it easier for new. users to get up to speed when interested in the project. 2. Get a critical mass of committers/PPMC members that can respond to. contributors, apply patches, nominate committers, and vote on releases. 3. Provide guidance on how to get involved in contributing.The incubator is already aware of the low level of activity, that many of.the PPMC are now disengaged and lack of mentors for the project. Konstantin.Boudnik has put his hand up to help out and that discussion is in progress.There continues to be interest in a new release from users, and new.interest from some in making contributions that continue to be followed up.Date of last release:. 2011-05-16.The last committer was added on 2011-04-19. There have not been any PPMC.additions since inception.Signed-off-by:. (npanday) Raphael Bircher.Shepherd/Mentor notes:.
