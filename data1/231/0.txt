iPMC Reviewers: rdonkinTika is a toolkit for detecting and extracting metadata and structured text content from various documents using existing parser libraries. Tika entered incubation on March 22nd, 2007.The Tika project has just started. The basic infrastructure (mailing lists, subversion, issue tracker, web site) is mostly in place; the only thing still missing is one committer account. We expect to get started with the actual design and code work during the next few weeks.
