River is aimed at the development and advancement of the Jini technology core infrastructure Jini technology is a service oriented architecture that defines a programming model which both exploits and extends Java technology to enable the construction of secure, distributed systems which are adaptive to change. River has been incubating since December 2006.Recent efforts included replacing make build scripts with ant and integrating the qa test suite with the main build. The jtreg test suite has some remaining issues to solve, namely setup and configure a Kerberos KDC test server, a zone has been set up for this purpose at river.zones.apache.org , in a addition a proxy server is also required to replace the functionality of the sun jiniproxy server. Most jtreg tests are passing, it would be desirable to have all pass prior to releasing AR2.Minor modifications need to be made to the ant build scripts to build the ClassDep.jar manifest correctly to include required libraries following recent ClassDep reimplementation changes to eliminate dependency upon internal implementation of Sun's JDK. Once resolved we are clear to release AR2.There has been some some recent interest in implementing compression and caching of bytecode. Other interests include class versioning and codebase services.After AR2, focus will be on support for Java 5 features, such as annotations and reducing the barriers to entry for new contributor developers.Required before graduation:.AR2 Release.Change com.sun.jini. namespace to org.apache.river.Reduce barriers to entry for new developers.Increased committer participation.Signed off by:.
