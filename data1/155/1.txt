Big Data Machine Learning in SQL for Data Scientists.MADlib has been incubating since 2015-09-15.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Produce a first Apache (incubating) release. 2. Expand the community, increase dev list activity and add new. committers/pmc members. 3. Execute and manage the project according to governance model required. by the "Apache Way”.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. None.How has the community developed since the last report?. 1. Meetup 10/1/15 @ Pivotal Labs, New York, NY: “MADlib and HAWQ for. Advanced SQL Machine Learning on Hadoop” http://s.apache.org/VbG. 2. Meetup 10/29/15 @ Pivotal Palo Alto, CA: “Data Science at Scale for. IoT” http://www.meetup.com/Pivotal-Open-Source-Hub/events/225426787/.How has the project developed since the last report?. 1. All known issues related to IP cleanliness described in. https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/MADlibProposal have been fixed and. pushed to the Apache repo. 2.

A new Greenplum DB sandbox VM with MADlib pre-installed has been. created and made available publicly at. https://github.com/greenplum-db/gpdb-sandbox-tutorials. The goal is to. make it easier to onboard new community members - they can download and. start trying MADlib right away with no install/setup. 6. A "catchup JIRA" was filed. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MADLIB-912 in order to catch up. between the time of the code grand to Apache and bringing in dev work. that was already in flight at the time. We apologize for any. inconvenience in clubbing together these multiple items; it was a. one-time operation. .Date of last release:.
