(helix) Patrick Hunt. (helix) Olivier Lamy. (helix) Mahadev Konar. (helix) Owen O'Malley.Shepherd notes:.Suresh Marru: The podling is healthy and I echo it seems ready to graduate. They have cut few releases, are engaging well with contributors and voted in two new committers. Its a small group with activity on the low end but the diversity is decent enough and podling seems to be ready for self-governance. If the project decides to graduate, it might be advisable for one or two mentors continue through for a little while.
