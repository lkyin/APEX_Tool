The ADF Faces / Trinidad project solved lot's of todos We repackaged the software to get rid of adf inside the namespace. We also renamed some of the JSF components. We managed to get a website and deployed it the the incubator site. We created a first RC of our maven2 plugins, which is currently under review phase by some Incubator PMC members. The size of committers is grwoing. Added two new committers to the project during the last three month. Users (or developers) action is much beyond from just sending questions. Jira is a important fact of this community, where users apply patches to. The community is still growing. In August we had 438 sent to the developers list. In July it have been 266.
