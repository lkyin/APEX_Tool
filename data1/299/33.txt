Slider is a collection of tools and technologies to package, deploy, and.manage long running applications on Apache Hadoop YARN clusters.Slider has been incubating since 2014-04-29.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Apache Slider community/PPMC has voted to move portions of Slider into. Apache Hadoop YARN as modules. It is possible that the remaining pieces. will be moved at a later point in time or become obsolete or evolve to. work closely with YARN. Slider PPMC will decide what makes the most. sense as we progress through this exciting time. 2. Getting more external users. 3. Growth of a diverse set of developers/committers/PMC members is also. crucial towards the final state of Slider.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware.of?. No.How has the community developed since the last report?. There has been one new contributor since the last report. Mailing list. activity has been lower due to the bulk of the development moving to an. Apache Hadoop branch, but the lists are still active.How has the project developed since the last report?. Work continues in parallel on the Apache Hadoop yarn-native-services. branch and on the Slider podling. The bulk of the work has been in. yarn-native-services, while a few Slider patches (related to critical. issues or agent-only issues) have been committed as well.Date of last release:. 2016-06-28 slider-0.91.0-incubating.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?. 2015-07-07: Yu (Thomas) Liu.Signed-off-by:.
