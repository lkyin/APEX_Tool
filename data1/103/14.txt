James and Scott are using etch in their current projects, and Youngjin would like to pick up the c-binding. What we lack is the organizational energy to get things moving.Release 1.1 is ready but needs some administrative polish before it is done.Release 1.2 is next in the pipeline.Our continuous integration build problem will only be solved by one of us hosting it at our new gigs. James and Scott are looking into this.Outstanding items:.More community. we have been Cisco-centered with just a few nibbles outside of Cisco. Things are definitely changing with members employed or so to be employed in different places. Building a stronger community remains our key task. We wish we knew how.Signed off by mentor: dashorst.
