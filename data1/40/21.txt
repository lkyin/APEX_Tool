Tamaya is a highly flexible configuration solution based on an modular,.extensible and injectable key/value based design, which should provide a.minimal but extendible modern and functional API leveraging SE, ME and EE.environments.Tamaya has been incubating since 2014-11-14.Shepherd/Mentor notes:. John D. Ament:. . The project continues to struggle. I'm not sure its recoverable as an. ASF project at this time. May make sense to reboot in an external. resource, e.g. GitHub, build a true community, and then come back.
