The STATUS file for the project is up to date The code is clean and using only Apache-compliant libraries, it has the correct copyright notices and is in the org.apache.servicemix namespace. We've got all the software grants sorted and all developers have their CLAs on file and accounts created. The project has very active mailing lists.The code base is going through a stabilization phase. The community is actively working on cutting Servicemix 3.0 M1 release candidates. Hopefully once of those release candidates will make it to a votes and pass soon.The website home page has now been sorted out and is being checked into svn. The static HTML is being generated from a Confluence wiki and content is very easy to update now. See: http://incubator.apache.org/servicemix/.
