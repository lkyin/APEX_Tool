The ODF Toolkit is a set of Java modules that allow programmatic creation, scanning and manipulation of OpenDocument Format (ISO/IEC 26300 == ODF) documents. Unlike other approaches which rely on runtime manipulation of heavy-weight editors via an automation interface, the ODF Toolkit is lightweight and ideal for server use. ODF Toolkit entered incubation on Aug 1st, 2011. Most important issues to address. 1) Growing the community, increasing diversity of committers. 2) Technical migration from the ODF Toolkit Union to Apache infrastructure, including code repository, website, bugzilla and wiki. 5) Successful podling release. Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of. None at this time. How has the community developed since the last report. The mailing lists are ready now for 23 days. We have 37 subscribers. We invited the existing users to this new community and are trying to attract more new people join us. This should be easier once we have code in the repository. How has the project developed since the last report.Requests are in queue with Apache Infra for loading the code repostiory and the issue tracker. 70% website and wiki migration work has been done.Signed off by mentor:.
