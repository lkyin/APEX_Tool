OpenNLP is a machine learning based toolkit for the processing of natural language text. It supports the most common NLP tasks, such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference resolution. These tasks are usually required to build more advanced text processing services.OpenNLP entered incubation on 11/23 2010.Since we last reported in January we continued to fill up jira with more issues, rewrote our maven.based build to comply with general Apache rules and to be ready to create our first release, fixed a few minor.bugs and re-factored parts of the chunker, migrated the SourceForge wiki documentation into a docbook for inclusion in future releases, added build instructions to the website.We decided to focus on our first release, which will hopefully be out in March. The release will just contain OpenNLP without any statistical models to avoid any legal issues which might delay the release.Regression testing will mostly be done on private data.There has been daily activity on dev mailing list and a little less on the user mailing list.A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. Resolve potential IP issues around releasing training models. Do a release. Establish open regression tests.Signed off by mentor: Grant Ingersoll.
