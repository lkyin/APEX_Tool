(taverna) Andy Seaborne. (taverna) Chris Mattmann. (taverna) Suresh Srinivas. (taverna) Suresh Marru. (taverna) Marlon Pierce.Shepherd/Mentor notes:. Andy Seaborne (andy):. Dev discussions have slowed right down this quarter. Developer. effort was strong for GSoC but there is now a minimum with no. prospect of a change until Jan/Feb next year. A worry I have. is that this was not communicated until considerable prompting. applied. There are only 2 active mentors. Marlon Pierce (mpierce):. +1 for Andy's comments. After a very promising summer, the project has. come to a halt. Despite mentor prompting, the project did not take the. opportunity to grow its community from active GSOC participants. John D. Ament (johndament):. Reading through the report, it seems that there may be some issues to be. raised up.
