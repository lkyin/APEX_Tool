iPMC Reviewers: jimProject name - Lucene.Net.Description - Lucene.Net is a source code, class-per-class, API-per-API and algorithmatic port of the Java Lucene search engine to the C# and .NET platform utilizing Microsoft .NET Framework.Date of entry - April, 2006.Top item(s) to resolve - Increase the development community and participation. Since the incubation of Lucene.Net, there has been only one active committer, George Aroush, who has done 99% of the port work. This has slowed the port effort such that we are now over 3 months behind with out 2.1 release. Currently, I have tried to re-energies this effort and emphasized that without developers, Lucene.Net will suffer and never graduate. I have gotten several mails offering to help, I will work on those and try to build the development community.Community aspects - There is a good followers, with good user base. A lot of questions get asked and answered on the user list.Code aspects - Released version 2.0 "final" on April 2007. Released version 2.1 "alpha" on May 2007.
