Airavata is a software toolkit currently used to build science gateways but that has a much wider potential use. It provides features to compose, manage, execute, and monitor large scale applications and workflows on computational resources ranging from local clusters to national grids and computing clouds.A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation. 1. Finish the security paper work needed to import donated code with cryptographic dependencies. 2. Engage the community by document existing design, drafting detailed JIRA tasks defining smaller goals. . 3. Remove incompatible license dependencies and implement over ALV2 compatible libraries. 4. Simplify the build process and provide simple to use cases. . 5. At least one Apache Incubator release. 6. Develop a strong community with organizational diversity and well aligned with existing ASF projects as outlined here: http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/AiravataProposal#Alignment .Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.No, not at this time.How has the community developed since the last report?.The interactions to date have been focused on development, and getting the project started.How has the project developed since the last report?.Airavata was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on May 7, 2011.Suresh Marru is pushing forward on the Airavata website. There is also work going on related to this to define a new Apache Airavata logo. In addition, Suresh led a development roadmap discussion. .Signed off by mentor: mattmann .
