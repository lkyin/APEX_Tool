Celix is an OSGi like implementation in C with a distinct focus on interoperability between Java and C.Celix has been incubating since 2010-11-02.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Grow a community. 2. Find more committers. 3. .Celix is maintained by 2 committers and a small group of users. Questions to the mailing list are (most of the time) answered quickly. We are also trying to give talks on Celix or related stuff on conferences.We see and recognise the problem of the small community, but are also confident that Celix and its community will grow.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.None.How has the community developed since the last report?.There is no active growth, but there is currently one students doing his intership with Apache Celix and we are trying hoping to get some projects in the Google Summer of Code 2013. We hope that this will lead in more activity on the mailing-list and hopefully to extra committers.How has the project developed since the last report?.Technically progress has been slow the last months. There was a hackaton organized for remote services in Java [1], which although not directly related to Apache Celix, should eventually work together with the Apache Celix and as result the committers of Apache Celix where present. We also expect an increase in contributions the coming months because of the student intership / GSoC activities.[1] http://lists.amdatu.org/pipermail/dev/2013-March/000020.html.Please check this when you have filled in the report for Celix.Signed-off-by:.Marcel Offermans: (celixKarl Pauls: (celixLuciano Resende: (celix.Shepherd notes:.
