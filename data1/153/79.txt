Lucene.Net was accepted into the Apache Incubator in February 2011. Originally it was a sub project of the Lucene Project.Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C# and targeted at .NET runtime users. Lucene.Net has three primary goals:. Maintain the existing line-by-line port from Java to C#, fully automating and commoditizing the process such that the project can easily synchronize with the Java Lucene release schedule. High-performance C# search engine library. Maximize usability and power when used within the .NET runtime. To that end, it will present a highly idiomatic, carefully tailored API that takes advantage of many of the special features of the .NET runtime.Recent Activity:. Lucene.Net 2.9.4 & 2.9.4g are being worked on and tested. The 'g' stands for generics. The 2.9.4g version now uses .NET 4.0. Prototyped build scripts with ncover, fxcop, style cop, nunit/mbunit, and sandcastle have been made.Current Activities:. New site design per new Lucene.Net logo. StackOverflow was gracious enough to put together a logo contest including footing the bill. The incubation site now shows the logo that was picked from the contest. http://incubator.apache.org/lucene.net/. Working towards getting CI installed. The shingle filter was ported. A simple faceted search contrib project was created. Develop a process to automatically (as much as possible) convert the Java Lucene code to C# (to maintain our line by line port.Goals for graduation:. Have a nearly fully automated process to convert Java Lucene to C#. Release Lucene.Net 3.0.3 (port of Java Lucene 3.0.3 Have a new .NET version of Lucene utilizing .NET constructs and idioms.Signed off by mentor: bodewig.
