Graffito is a framework for content-based applications, especially in portlet environments Graffito entered incubation on September 20, 2004.Top three items to resolve before graduation:.Build a self-sustaining community 2. Create an incubating Graffito release 3. Move the JCR mapping component to the Jackrabbit project.There hasn't been much activity in the Graffito project since the last report. A discussion on what to do with the project that still hasn't reached "critical mass" after over two years of incubation is currently taking place. The perceived complexity of the project is seen by many as a barrier to start using or contributing to Graffito. Splitting the project into more manageable component projects was raised as one potential approach to reviving the codebase and project community.
