A 1.1 release is now being vetted and we hope to vote on it soon. The 1.1 release includes proper package names, bug fixes, enhancements, and also new code contributions in support of c and python bindings (not yet fully functional.Our problem with finding a home for our continuous build continues. Various plans have been proposed and failed due to lack of a Windows-friendly c# build environment. Cisco is no longer hosting our build environment. We need to find a place do public builds.Cisco folks continue to be the primary source of discussion and commits. There are some external nibbles, but none that are ready to pitch-in in a serious way yet. More work needs to be done on the web site to make steps to participation more evident. Work also needs to be done on the build environment to make it easier to get started. Some of the etch committers have left Cisco, more will soon follow.Also in April, Manoj Ganesan (Dell) has been accepted by the incubator pmc to be our newest etch committer. Seth Call and JD Liau have withdrawn from the project.I believe all of the outstanding items are done, but it isn't clear to me (scott) what the process is to check them off.Outstanding items:.Check and make sure that the papers that transfer rights to the ASF been received.Check and make sure that the files that have been donated have been updated to reflect the new ASF copyright.Check and make sure that for all code included with the distribution that is not under the Apache license.Check and make sure that all source code distributed by the project is covered by one or more of the following approved licenses.
