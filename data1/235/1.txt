This last month, the team has worked hard on code cleanup, preparing the code for submission into the Incubator SVN server We still have some cleanup to do, but there is light at the end of the tunnel. Traffic Server is having a Meetup at ApacheCon, Tuesday night, where we will present our progress, as well as give an overview of the code architecture, and typical use case scenarios for TS. Our goal is of course to be done with the code cleanup, and SVN migration, well before ApacheCon.Signed off by: cutting.
