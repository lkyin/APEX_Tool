On the Java side, Community and code development are continuing We have added two new committers (Ant Elder and Daniel Kulp) since the last report and have many other people active on the mailing lists. We have been working toward a Java release which is intended to allow others to easily contribute plugins and other functionality in order to further expand the community. A vote on a candidate started on the development list (as of 5/18/06) and if passed we will be asking the Incubator PMC for permission to release it.After a slower start development is now also ramping up on the C++ codebase but additional effort will be needed to attract new community members.
