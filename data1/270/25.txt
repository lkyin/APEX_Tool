iPMC Reviewers: jerenkrantz, yoavs, twl(This is the extra followup report requested by the board last month.Graffito is a framework for content-based applications, especially in portlet environments. Graffito entered incubation on September 20, 2004.The recent discussion on the status of the Graffito project has concluded with some concrete action items (see http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-graffito-dev/200702.mbox/%3c3b728ee90702140445i5d21bd22j95fb5b67c58abc70@mail.gmail.com%3e The plan is to realign Graffito to be more a content management framework instead of a complete CMS product and to better leverage the features of JCR content repositories.The effect of these plans on commit activity remains to be seen, but as of now the general feeling around the project is positive. Hopefully we'll have some concrete results to show by the time of the next report.
