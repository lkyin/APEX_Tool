(taverna) Andy Seaborne. Comments:.In Dec 2016, the report said "Preparing to graduate." In 2017, the dev@ list has been quiet and the last release was in 2016.While the PPMC is large, not everyone has been active in incubation. I am worried that pushing through graduation will only result in the same situation as a TLP.The community needs to consider what is the best environment for Taverna. (taverna) Daniel J Debrunner.
