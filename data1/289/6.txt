Olio has been incubating since September 2008.Olio is a web 2.0 toolkit to help developers evaluate the suitability, functionality and performance of various web technologies by implementing a reasonably complex application in several different technologies.Olio is continuing to gain users and being used for diverse purposes.One user is using it for testing MySQL performance.Another is using it for testing performance of file systems.Microsoft has started a .NET port of Olio.VMWare has joined the project and plans to use it for several of their performance testing efforts.There are multiple deployments attempting to scale Olio to test performance of system infrastructure, software application stack etc.A lot of work has gone to make the product more robust and stable over long benchmark runs - over 50 JIRA issues have been fixed.Work is underway to create the first release. The artificats are tested; the major work is in fixing the source headers, licenses etc.Olio has been presented to some Apache and Rails Meetups to get attention.We're encouraging users to become active in contributing to the code.
