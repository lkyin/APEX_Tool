The last month has been focusing on code cleanup and build system changes The Traffic Server project was accepted into the incubator in July 2009, and we're still actively working on getting the community built up and to get ready for an Open Source release of TS.The Yahoo! team has worked on the following code cleanup tasks in preparation for the code migration:.All Coverity issues (that are relevant) have been fixed.All code that we are not Open Sourcing (at this point) has been removed.We have eliminated all Yahoo! proprietary code, cleaned up comments, and unnecessary attributions.Build system has been reworked / improved, and the cleaned up code now builds and run.We have eliminated a few licensing issues (there was nothing there that would prevent us to push the code to SVN, but our legal wanted this to be eliminated before code push.In addition, we have completed the following incubator tasks:.SVN area has been created (in preparation for code push), http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/trafficserver/.Confluence Wiki has been created, and documentation migration has begun, http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TS/Index .Outstanding Incubator tasks include:.We're working on a final sign-off from our (Yahoo!) Legal Department, which is currently holding us back from pushing the code. The goal here is to assure that we have full distribution rights to all code that we push to Apache SVN.Migrate project code to ASF infrastructure.Get the Trademark issue resolved (see below.Finish the ASF copyright and license attribution in all source files (this is partway done.Also, we'd like to bring up again the proposal that we made during the incubator process for how to deal with the Traffic Server trademark. Our preferred option is the following (from Chuck Neerdaels and our legal dept):.The preferred option is to provide ASF with a letter of assurance stating that we own all right, title and interest in and to the TRAFFIC SERVER mark and the four active registrations and that we will not take any action against ASF or any of its licensees during the life of these registrations {and we'd express our intention of letting them lapse and expire].If this is acceptable to ASF, then that is what we'll do. If not, the other alternative, which is more elaborate, is to assign all rights for the Traffic Server trademark to the ASF.Signed off by mentor: Doug Cutting.
