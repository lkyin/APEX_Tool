The WSRP4J Project is an implementation of WSRP 10 Producer. WSRP is an OASIS specification that describes a protocol which allows portlets to be accessed remotely using Web Services.The WSRP4J Project has been adopted by the Portals PMC, while still in the Apache Incubator, with the intent to eventually graduate as a sub-project of Apache Portals.However, there has been no changes nor real activity in the WSRP4J project for quite some time.While the the interest for WSRP4J might seem to have dwindled, several active Apache Portals committers still belief there is a real potential to reactivate this project, especially in the light of the new WSRP 2.0 OASIS specification. As the only existing "open" standard in this area, interest for a formal release also has been expressed (privately) by several large organizations, including governmental.Furthermore, even while there hasn't been a formal WSRP4J (incubator) release so far, in reality its codebase has been adapted and is in use by non ASF products and projects quite a lot.But the primary reason why further development has been stalled is a legal one with regards to IPR. Two parties of the WSRP technical committee, IBM and WebCollage, have stated patent claims on the WSRP specification. See also: http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/wsrp/ipr.php Concerning the claims from IBM we think those are not limiting us to produce an ASF compliant release of WSRP4J. But we are still not sure about the claims from WebCollage.Last year, with the help from legal-internal, we have pursuit to resolve these uncertainties, and there has been preliminary contact with WebCollage, but this has stalled again. We still hope we can resolve this satisfactory, but we do seek further help and legal advise how to proceed.
