(wave) Christian Grobmeier.Shepherd/Mentor notes:. Marvin Humphrey (marvin):. Wave's report was deliberately not signed off by its Mentors. Mentor. Upayavira engaged the Wave community about the possibility of retiring. The community preferred to continue; a timeline for making an incubating. release was discussed. Upayavira (upayavira):. As Marvin observed, I'm doubtful that Wave has the momentum to make. any significant change nor to progress towards graduation. The community. will need to meet some targets - the immediate one is to make a release . before the next board report is due.
