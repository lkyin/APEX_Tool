Tez is an effort to develop a generic application framework which can be used to process arbitrarily complex data-processing tasks and also a re-usable set of data-processing primitives which can be used by other projects.Tez has been incubating since 2013-02-24.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Develop collaborations with other Apache projects, including Hadoop, YARN. 2. Make an initial Tez release. 3. Grow the Apache Tez community.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.None at this time.How has the community developed since the last report?.The community is still bootstrapping. .How has the project developed since the last report?.A few jiras have been created and some patches have been filed.Mailing lists for dev, private, and commits are up and running.There have been some JIRAs, Git is up and running and a couple of larger code contributions have been made. Chris raised this as a potential issue. In the meanwhile, moderate-low development is occuring.Please check this when you have filled in the report for Tez.Signed-off-by: .Alan Gates: (tezArun Murthy: (tezChris Douglas: (tezChris Mattmann: (tezJakob Homan: (tezOwen O'Malley: (tez.Shepherd notes:
