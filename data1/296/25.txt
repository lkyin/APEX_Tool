Ripple is a browser based mobile phone emulator designed to aid in the development of HTML5 based mobile applications. Ripple is a cross platform and cross runtime testing/debugging tool. It currently supports such runtimes as Cordova, WebWorks and the Mobile Web.Ripple has been incubating since 2012-10-16.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.The community recently discussed the lack of growth in the project. Some members felt that retirement of the podling was appropriate. Others have stepped up to take over essential tasks and attempt to build a community. We have agreed with mentors to review this situation in 6 months. It is possible that Ripple is no longer important as its functionality is potential being replaced by Cordova-browser. Our original champion, Ross Gardler has also up to help evaluate the situation. For Cordova-browser idea, there was also a discussion on the mailing list. .How has the community developed since the last report?.No new committers since last June 2014. .How has the project developed since the last report?.Minor user contributions.Date of last release:.No release made as yet, this will be the first item to recieve attention. .When were the last committers or PMC members elected?.June, 2014.Signed-off-by:.
