Kato was accepted into the Incubator on 6 November 2008.Kato is a project to develop the Specification, Reference Implementation, and TCK for JSR 326: the JVM Post-mortem Diagnostics API.Recent Activity:. While Oracle has expressed a continued interest in the JSR-326, there has been no change in the podling's status since the last report in June. As in June, the project is effectively paused until Oracle's involvement in the Kato podling has been clarified. The credibility of the standard relies on there being more than one major Java VM vendor involved.The following is planned for next reporting period:. To be determined once Oracle's involvement has been established.Before this project can graduate we need to encourage more participation in the project and grow the community.Signed off by mentor: ant.
