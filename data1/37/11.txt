Singa is a distributed deep learning platform.Singa has been incubating since 2015-03-17.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Improve the system, including performance and features like distributed. GPU training over GPU clusters, R binding, etc. 2. Add more examples and documentation to attach users. 3. Grow the community. We have been trying to reach out to a more diverse. community of developers and users by presenting SINGA for various. audiences. Completing items 1 and 2 above would attract more. contributors and users.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. No.How has the community developed since the last report?. The Github repository has scored 540 stars and 190 forks. There were 60, 180 and 7 commits in Dec 2015, Jan 2016 and Feb 2016. respectively. There were 77, 105, 13 emails from dev@ list in Dec 2015, Jan 2016 and Feb. 2016 respectively.How has the project developed since the last report?. In Jan 2016, we released our second version, i.e., incubating-v0.2.0, with. the following major features:. GPU support, which enables training of complex models on a single node. with multiple GPU cards. Hybrid neural net partitioning, which supports data and model. parallelism at the same time. Python wrapper, which makes it easy to configure the job, including. neural net and SGD algorithm. RNN model and BPTT algorithms, to support applications based on RNN. models, e.g., GRU. Cloud software integration includes Mesos, Docker and HDFS.Date of last release:. 2016-01-14.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?. N/A.Signed-off-by:. (singa) Daniel Dai. (singa) Alan Gates. (singa) Ted Dunning. (singa) Thejas Nair.
