Etch was accepted into Incubator on 2 September 2008.Etch is a cross-platform, language- and transport-independent framework for building and consuming network services. The Etch toolset includes a network service description language, a compiler, and binding libraries for a variety of programming languages.After the stumbling blocks reported last month, i.e. trouble to get going with infrastructure, the project is now up and running. All external code, documentation and Jira issues have been ported into the Apache Etch project. Development activity is medium (~30 commits in 2 weeks), from mainly two developers. The first posts to the etch-user list is promising, but development list is still a "Post Jira -> Fix It" without much mailing list discussion. This will be the main focal point to resolve over the next quarter.The main splash page (http://incubator.apache.org/projects/etch.html) is still incomplete. The process to update the main page is burdensome. I've seen someone else suggest using an automated background process to incorporate changes and strongly support that idea.The last remaining infrastructural issue is to find a home for our continuous build system. It requires a Windows home because of C# and microsoft visual studio components.
