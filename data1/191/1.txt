Pivot has been in incubation since January 2009.Pivot is an open-source platform for building rich internet applications in Java.Noel Grandin was added as a new committer on 3/29.The codebase was forked into the "WTKX" project at Google Code: http://code.google.com/p/wtkx/. We didn't get a clear answer from the developer as to why he chose to fork rather than collaborate. From what we can gather, he seems to want to do Pivot "his own way".The Pivot PPMC is currently voting on a proposed 1.1 release. Work has begun on a 1.1.1 maintenance release and 1.2 feature release.Top 3 issues prior to graduation:.Successfully complete the 1.1 release.Strengthen the understanding of The Apache Way and how to operate a PMC.Even stronger community; currently quite good with 5 active committers from 4 different employers.
