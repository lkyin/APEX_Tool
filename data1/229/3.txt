Tez is an effort to develop a generic application framework which can be used to process arbitrarily complex data-processing tasks and also a re-usable set of data-processing primitives which can be used by other projects.Tez has been incubating since 2013-02-24.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Develop collaborations with other Apache projects, including Hadoop, YARN. 2. Make an initial Tez release. 3. Grow the Apache Tez community.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.None at this time.How has the community developed since the last report?.No new PPMC members or committers added since the last report. We need.to work to do a better job of identifying new contributors, but there.is great activity so I don't think this will be a big issue.Another here that we need to do a better job of here is discussing issues.on list. I see lots of JIRAs and commits, but few [DISCUSS] and other threads.There was a discussion of merging TEZ-1 which is great though.How has the project developed since the last report?.1. 109 issues resolved and 81 currently open in JIRA (lots of work going on.2. Discussion to merge TEZ-1 (branch) into master.3.
