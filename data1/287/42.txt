NPanday allows projects using the .NET framework to be built with Apache.Maven.NPanday has been incubating since 2010-08-13.Since the last report in July:. - the build issues on the Windows Jenkins slaves were resolved. - further JIRA issues have been cleaned up to prepare for the release. - Konstantin Boudnik was formally added as a mentor for the project.While some progress was made towards getting the release out, there is .still more work to do as time allows.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Ship the changes on trunk as a release and make it easier for new . users to get up to speed when interested in the project. 2. Get a critical mass of committers/PPMC members that can respond to . contributors, apply patches, nominate committers, and vote on releases. 3. Provide guidance on how to get involved in contributing.The incubator is already aware of the low level of activity, that many of .the PPMC are now disengaged. There continues to be interest in a new .release from users, and new interest from some in making contributions that.continue to be followed up.Date of last release:. 2011-05-16.The last committer was added on 2011-04-19. There have not been any PPMC .additions since inception.Signed-off-by:. (npanday) Raphael Bircher. (npanday) Konstantin Boudnik.
