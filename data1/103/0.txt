Etch was accepted into Incubator on the 2 September 2008 Since then the following items has been completed;.Project STATUS page, navigation and entry in projects/index.html has been set up.Mailing lists has been set up.Jira project has been set up.ICLAs for all initial committers has been submitted and recorded.We are still waiting for a CCLA from Cisco, where all initial committers work. We also track all progress in JIRA (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INCUBATOR-83) which is a lot easier than the STATUS page, and highly recommended for future recommended use to other podlings.
