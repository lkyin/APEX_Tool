The ODF Toolkit is a set of Java modules that allow programmatic creation, scanning and manipulation of OpenDocument Format (ISO/IEC 26300 == ODF) documents. Unlike other approaches which rely on runtime manipulation of heavy-weight editors via an automation interface, the ODF Toolkit is lightweight and ideal for server use. ODF Toolkit entered incubation on Aug 1st, 2011. Most important issues to address. 1) Moving the community from the ODF Toolkit Union to Apache and learning the Apache Way. 2) Growing the community, increasing diversity of committers. 3) Grants for the transfer of existing code, documentation etc to Apache. 4) Migration of existing things to Apache infrastructure, including code repository, website, mailing list, bugzilla and wiki. 5) Successful podling release. Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of. None at this time. How has the community developed since the last report. Just getting started. After mailing lists are ready (INFRA-3809), we will start to discuss migration and new release. At the same time, we will invite the existing users to this new community and try to attract more new people join us. How has the project developed since the last report. None at this time. Just getting started.Signed off by mentor: nick.
