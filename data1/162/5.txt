Apache Mnemonic is an advanced hybrid memory storage oriented library, we've.proposed a non-volatile/durable Java object model and durable computing.service that bring several advantages to significantly improve the.performance of massive real-time data processing/analytics. developers are.able to use this library to design their cache-less and SerDe-less high.performance applications.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Apache releases: we have release version 0.2.0-incubating. 2. Encouraging community participation and contribution. 3. Invented Durable Computing Model and Service on top of Durable Object. Model.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. No.How has the community developed since the last report?. Our last report was in April. Since then. Twelve new contributors have joined and seven contributors have submitted. their patches. We need to encourage more discussion on the dev list in the coming months.How has the project developed since the last report?. Added memory service and testcases. Added computing service and testcases. Re-organized sub-modules. Added Apache Rat and Checkstyle to ensure compliance. Added release.sh, runall.sh script tools. Supported Docker dev. construction. Removed the dependency of customized 3rd party library. Removed the dependency of special version of nvml. Constructed project website (WIP Supported discrete addressing for memory service. and other bugfixes, features, improvements.Date of last release:. 2016-08-02.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?.
