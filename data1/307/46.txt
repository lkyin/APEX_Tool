The WSRP4J Project is an implementation of WSRP 10 Producer. WSRP is an OASIS specification that describes a protocol which allows portlets to be accessed remotely using Web Services.The WSRP4J Project has been adopted by the Portals PMC, while still in the Apache Incubator, since August 2003, with the intent to graduate as a sub-project of Apache Portals.Activity: There is no project activity to report since the last report of August 2009. The IPR issue has been reviewed by the Legal Affairs Committee and formally stated to be OK with WSRP4J releasing and graduating.Many thanks to Niclas Hedhman for helping out enormously with this!.The project now hopefully will get back into action and start cleaning up the codebase, removing/replacing incompatible licensed dependencies (Hibernate) and working towards a first release. Still standing issue from last report: The current mentors haven't been interactive in a very long time, maybe other/new mentors might be interested to step up?.Signed off by mentor: taylor
