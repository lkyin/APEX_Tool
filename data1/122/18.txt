Apache HAWQ is a Hadoop native SQL query engine that combines the key.technological advantages of MPP database with the scalability and convenience.of Hadoop. HAWQ reads data from and writes data to HDFS natively. HAWQ.delivers industry-leading performance and linear scalability. It provides.users the tools to confidently and successfully interact with petabyte range.data sets. HAWQ provides users with a complete, standards compliant SQL.interface.HAWQ has been incubating since 2015-09-04.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Continue to improve the project's release cadence. To this end we. plan on expanding automation services to support increased. developer participation. 2. Continue to expand the community, by adding new contributors and. focusing on making sure that there's a much more robust level of. conversations and discussions happening around roadmaps and. feature development on the public dev mailing list. 3. Expand release artifacts to include the delivery of binary. artifacts.
