Entered incubation in May, 2005 Apache Harmony is primarily focused on the creation of an independent, compatible implementation of Java SE 5.The project has voted to ask to graduate from the Incubator, and is currently discussion the topic with the Incubator PMC.Progress continues in both code and community:.Community.The project has added 6 new committers.The project has added 3 committers to the PPMC.Diversity continues to increase in participants.Pure development list traffic hit a record of 1961 message with a combined volume of JIRA and commit messages of 2851.The ApacheCon technical session and BOF on Harmony were reasonably attended.Our interaction with the Yoko community has been constructive in terms of community - they elected a Harmony commmitter to be a Yoko committer - as well as technology (see belowWe have the support with the external MX4J project to "gently fork" their codebase as the foundation for our JMX 1.2 extentions as required by the Java SE 5 spec.Technology/Other.The project is in the process of updating it's license headers in the codebase. The classlibrary and DRLVM virtual machine have been updated, with the rest still in progress.Classlibrary coverage has reached 94%.DRLVM is stablizing and running at a reasonable level of performance.We've incorporated the binary milestone from Yoko as our implementation of CORBA, and will update with their release when that happens.We've accepted several tool contributions (javah, javap) and expect to produce a JDK snapshot complete with javac, javap, javah, rmic and keytool.JBoss now "runs" on Harmony (for certain values of "runs"MX4J as source (it has the Apache License) will be integrated into the project codebase as the starting point for our required JMX implementation in the classlibrary.
