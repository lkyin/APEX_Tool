Celix is an implementation of the OSGi Specification in C.Celix entered incubation on November 2, 2010.Over the past few months work has been done on integration and usage of the Apache Portable Runtim (APR) in Celix.The work has mostly focusses on stability and robustness of the codebase, but some new features were added:. Log Service and Writer: for logging and reading the log. Service Factories: needed for the log service.Also, in March, a talk was given to the OSGi User Group France. There is a lot interest in the project, but people seem to be waiting for a more stable version.For community building it might be interesting to work towards a release later this year to make it easier to download and use Celix.A talk on Celix has also been accepted for the ApacheCon in November, which is a good opportunity to show Celix to the world.Also parts of Celix have been ported to Windows. Mostly the utils used by the framework, and not yet the framework itself. This is a lengthy job because Celix is using C99, and Windows (Visual Studio) only support C89/C90.Most important issues are:. Improve robustness (APR, error handling etc Generate awareness and grow a community!.Signed off by mentor: marrs.
