MRQL is a query processing and optimization system for large-scale, distributed data analysis, built on top of Apache Hadoop and Hama.MRQL has been incubating since 2013-03-13.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Expand the development community to include more diverse committers. 2. Complete the first release. 3. Improve query performance on large clusters.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.none.How has the community developed since the last report?.We are in the process of completing the infrastructure for the MRQL .podling. We have created a new wiki site for MRQL that includes a .detailed developer documentation, which includes a guide to potential .committers on how to contribute to the MRQL project, gives a detailed .roadmap of the codebase, and lists the future release plans. This wiki .also contains user documentation of the MRQL query language. We have .also created a JIRA site for MRQL. So far we have created 9 JIRA .issues, some of them related to infrastructure improvement, from which .6 have already been resolved.How has the project developed since the last report?.The existing code has been substantially modified in many ways to .facilitate contributions by committers. The codebase now includes a .testbed of queries to automatically test various aspects of the .system. We are now in the process of refactoring the code based on our .coding guidelines and of using maven as our project management tool.Please check this when you have filled in the report for MRQL.Signed-off-by: .Alex Karasulu: (mrqlAnthony Elder: (mrqlAlan Cabrera: (mrqlMohammad Nour El-Din: (mrql.Shepherd notes:.
