Stdcxx status report for the calendar quarter ending in 9/2005:This is the first quarterly report for stdcxx.Since the inception of the stdcxx podling the stdcxx community has substantially completed the migration of the project from the Rogue Wave infrastructure to the Apache infrastructure. Notably, the source code of the library, the accompanying utility programs, a comprehensive set of example programs, as well as the complete project documentation in HTML have been transferred to Subversion. All source files have been modified to reflect the Apache license. A bug tracking database has been created in Jira and is being actively and extensively used to track issues and tasks. The appropriate mailing lists have been created. All new stdcxx committers have submitted their Contributor License Agreements.In September the stdcxx development community with the approval of the Incubator PMC published the first and final snapshot of the initially contributed sources, labeled version 4.1.2.At this time the stdcxx community is working toward version 4.1.3 of the project. The goals of this effort are to migrate the project test suite from the Rogue Wave test harness to the new stdcxx test driver, to complete the transfer of the tests from the Rogue Wave source code repository to Subversion, and to complete the implementation of the configuration and build infrastructure for Microsoft Windows. The estimated time-frame for reaching these goals is the first half of 2006.The objective of the stdcxx community for the next quarter is to work on further increasing the visibility of the project, attracting additional contributors, and growing the active community of developers around it.
