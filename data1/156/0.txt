--Description--.ManifoldCF is an incremental crawler framework and set of connectors designed to pull documents from various kinds of repositories into search engine indexes or other targets. The current bevy of connectors includes Documentum (EMC), FileNet (IBM), LiveLink (OpenText), Meridio (Autonomy), SharePoint (Microsoft), RSS feeds, and web content. ManifoldCF also provides components for individual document security within a target search engine, so that repository security access conventions can be enforced in the search results.ManifoldCF has been in incubation since January, 2010. It was originally a planned subproject of Lucene but is now a likely top-level project.--A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation--.1. We need at least three additional active committers, as well as additional users and repeat contributors.2. We should have at least one or two more releases before graduating.3. We'd like to see long-term contributions for project testing, especially infrastructure access.--Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?--.All issues have been addressed to our satisfaction at this time.--How has the community developed since the last report?--.A book is being written, and has entered the early-release phase, available from Manning Publishing. We continue to have user community interest. We've had a number of extremely helpful bug reports and contributions from the field. The active committer list remains short, however.--How has the project developed since the last report?--.An 0.1 release was made on January 31, 2011, and another release is being considered. Contributions extending the FileNet connector have been made, as well as contributions to the Solr connector.Signed off by mentor: Grant Ingersoll.
