The VXQuery Project implements a standard compliant XML Query.processor for parallel evaluation.It has been in incubation since 2009-07-06.VXQuery changed its focus from being a pure library implementation.of XQuery in Java to being an engine for parallel XQuery evaluation.For the runtime VXQuery now leverages the Hyracks system which is.an Apache-licensed parallel execution engine developed at UCI.So far the top issues were. 1) low activity. 2) small community. 3) create a release.The activities on these issues are:. ad 1 Since this change of focus - and the start of a GSoC project with. this new focus - development activity has picked up significantly. This due to both activity of the GSoC student (Preston Carman) and. of the existing committers. ad 2 Preston Carman a) has provided good patches for VXQuery and. b) interacts very well with the existing community. Consequently he is a candidate to be the next committer for VXQuery. After the initial vote on vxquery-private failed (all committers. voted +1, but there was no mentor/IPMC member vote), Jukka Zitting. voted +1. The next step is to finalize the administrative part to. make Preston a committer. Further, there is a plan to publish a paper to show the projects. utility and to increase the visibility of the incubation effort. ad 3 After the change of focus some things work, but not enough to. build a release that is easily consumable. VXQuery should be. released before a paper is published to enable readers or the. paper to run the software.Signed off by mentor:.Shepherd: Matt Franklin
