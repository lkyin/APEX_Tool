(introduced to Apache incubator on Jul 4, 2011Kafka provides an extremely high throughput distributed publish/subscribe messaging system. Additionally, it supports relatively long term persistence of messages to support a wide variety of consumers, partitioning of the message stream across servers and consumers, and functionality for loading data into Apache Hadoop for offline, batch processing.A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation. 1. Package, document and release at least one Apache Incubator release. 2. Develop a strong community with organizational diversity.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.No, not at this time.How has the community developed since the last report?.Just get started. The mailing list is pretty active, including people other than the initial committers.How has the project developed since the last report?. Moved everything (svn, website, mailing list, jira, wiki) in Kafka to Apache. CCLA from LinkedIn filed with Apache. The end-to-end compression feature is almost complete. Received various patches from 3 different companies, including dynamic topic discovering for cross-cluster mirroing, mx4j support, .net client, etc.Signed off by mentor:.Alan Cabrera.
