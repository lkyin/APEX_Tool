SAMOA provides a collection of distributed streaming algorithms for the most.common data mining and machine learning tasks such as classification,.clustering, and regression, as well as programming abstractions to develop.new algorithms that run on top of distributed stream processing engines.(DSPEs It features a pluggable architecture that allows it to run on.several DSPEs such as Apache Storm, Apache S4, and Apache Samza.SAMOA has been incubating since 2014-12-15.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1.
