Apache SIS is a toolkit that spatial information system builders or users can use to build applications containing location context. This project will look to store reference implementations of spatial algorithms, utilities, services, etc. as well as serve as a sandbox to explore new ideas. Further, the goal is to have Apache SIS grow into a thriving Apache top-level community, where a host of SIS/GIS related software (OGC datastores, REST-ful interfaces, data standards, etc.) can grow from and thrive under the Apache umbrella. Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.Not at this time. Community progress since the last report.Since SIS released its first release 0.1-incubating in November 2010, development has slowed down. This is a small core set of committers and community though. We haven't had a lot of user mailing list activity. .We should try and target a 0.2-incubating release with a layer service and some basic integration with Apache Tika (a GDAL parser is being worked on in that community with an eye towards integration into SIS Also we are looking at Apache OODT as a mechanism for geospatial storage and persistence. .There has been renewed interest from ESRI and we are pursuing this as well. Project progress since last report.SIS was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on February 21, 2010.Development progress since the 0.1-incubating release has been modest, focusing primarily on the community development mentioned above. There has been some internal effort at JPL to integrate SIS into ongoing projects such as the CO2 Portal, the CMDS project and others. We hope to begin the push towards 0.2-incubating as specified above.Signed off by mentor: mattmann, greddin, kevan.
