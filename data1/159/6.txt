Mesos is a cluster manager that provides resource sharing and isolation across cluster applications.Mesos entered incubation on December 23rd, 2010.Community. Mesos is being used at Twitter, Conviva, UCSF and UC Berkeley. We moved the source code into Apache SVN and started tracking development on JIRA. We accepted patches from several contributors through JIRA and GitHub. We've also made various improvements to the website and documentation to make the project easier to set up and use.Project development. Since the last report, we completed a migration to protocol buffer based communication (to enable rolling upgrades), several fault tolerance improvements, several fixes to Linux Container based isolation, a new client API based on protocol buffers to allow applications to also work on future versions, and porting existing applications (e.g. Hadoop) to use the new API.Most important issues to address. Put together a first incubating release of Mesos. Grow the community and add more committers.Signed off by mentor: tomwhite.
