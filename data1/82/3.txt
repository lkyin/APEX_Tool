Commons RDF is a set of interfaces and classes for RDF 1.1 concepts and.behaviours. The commons-rdf-api module defines interfaces and testing.harness. The commons-rdf-simple module provides a basic reference.implementation to exercise the test harness and clarify API contracts.CommonsRDF has been incubating since 2015-03-06.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Build community. 2. Further engage the podling with the nuances of the Apache. Incubation process. 3.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. See community section.How has the community developed since the last report?. The community still needs to find a discussion mode based on. consensus and compromise. Certain techncial issues in RDF. lead to entrenched positions (this is not unique to the podling;. there are such long discussions outside ASF. This has lead to a lack of energy and one person stepping back. from the project in this reporting period.How has the project developed since the last report?. The project made its first release on 2015-05-15.Date of last release:. 2015-05-15.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?. None added so far.Signed-off-by:. (commonsrdf) Rob Vesse. (commonsrdf) John D Ament. (commonsrdf) Gary Gregory.Shepherd/Mentor notes:.rvesse - The strong differences of opinion over some aspects of RDF are.as reported by the podling causing some issues and they have yet to find a.satisfactory way to build consensus and move forward on some of these. As.noted this is not unusual in the wider world, even within the ASF we have.5 different TLPs that use RDF who between them use 3 different APIs each.with very different world views so building that cross project consensus.and moving forward on releases has the potential to be a blocker to.progress and graduation.
