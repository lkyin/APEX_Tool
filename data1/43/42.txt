Toree provides applications with a mechanism to interactively and remotely access Apache Spark.Toree has been incubating since 2015-12-02.Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:.Active community.Increase active contributors.Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?.None.How has the community developed since the last report?.Toree will have a talk at ApacheCon Las Vegas where we will talk about its overall status and current functionality as well as try to attract more users and in particular contributors.After the release of Toree 0.3.0 the community slowed down, mostly due to Toree being somewhat stable and running on top of Spark, where the public APIs in use are also stable.The community needs to work on a release that supports Apache Spark 2.4.x and Scala 2.12.Toree might be one of those low activity projects which have enough active PPMCs (see last ppmc voting thread), and we might start graduation talks based on these facts.How has the project developed since the last report?.Very little activity on the last few months after the Toree 0.3.0 release, mostly around some compatibility issues with Spark 2.4.x and Scala 2.12.How would you assess the podling's maturity?.Please feel free to add your own commentary. Community building. Nearing graduation.Date of last release:.2018-11-13.When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?.Kevin Bates was added to the PPMC on 2019-08-14.Have your mentors been helpful?.There was nothing requiring mentor intervention on the last quarter.Signed-off-by:.
