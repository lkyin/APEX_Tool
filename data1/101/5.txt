Empire-db is a relational data persistence component that aims to overcome the difficulties, pitfalls and restrictions inherent in traditional Object Relational Management (ORM) approaches Empire-db is on the Apache Incubator since July 2008.Recent activity:.After the acceptance and publication of the first Apache release in October there has been a discussion going on about what would be the most important improvement for the upcoming release. A suggestion was made to provide a Maven like distribution that will allow to access and build Empire-db with Maven instead of the classic .jar file distribution with Ant build files. While the benefits of this suggestion were soon agreed upon on the developer mailing list, this started a long and verbose discussion on how to go about the issue. Ideas ranged from a basic and slow transition to a Maven big bang.Since the core development team had no experience with Maven it was also necessary to find someone with the skills to get it right. We were happy to find a community member who was capable and willing to perform this task. After different transition models have been discussed he was given the freedom to decide on the most suitable approach. Since then the Maven transition has been going on in a different SVN branch that is planned to be merged with the trunk for the next release.Besides that the developers participated in discussions and blogs about relational data persistence on non Apache sites such as www.theserverside.com. An interesting article here http://fromapitosolution.blogspot.com/2008/12/criticism-of-java-persistence.html proves that this is still a hot topic with many who could benefit from Emipre-db.Plans for the future are:.Finish the Maven transition and provide a Maven style release.Provide further documentation and example applications.Community aspects:.For the transition to a Maven style distribution we were happy to find a new committer for our project. Francis De Brabandere who we believe has excellent Maven skills offered his services and was accepted by the current development team and the mentors.PMC Comment: A good report, but please include ALL three (3) items requested by the ASF Board of each report.
