Apache Spot is a solution stack that provides the capability to ingest.network related telemetry (network flows, domain name service.information and proxy server logs) and provide unsupervised machine.learning capabilities to identify suspicious activity. The information.is organized and presented using operational analytics so that a.security analyst can investigate the most suspicious connections. Apache.Spot is built on an open data model using Apache Spark and Apache.Hadoop.Spot has been incubating since 2016-09-23.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Move infrastructure and development to ASF (code, issues, mailing list, . 2. Build diverse community. 3. Demonstrate ability to create releases.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?.Please elaborate on the process for code scanning and IP.reviews.How has the community developed since the last report?.Community interaction has ramped velocity, as new adopters of the.project have been posting questions through Twitter and Slack. We have.added approximately 20% to our Slack channel and added several.contributors through the ICLA.How has the project developed since the last report?.We have moved our repo to ASF as of December 8, 2016.We have removed our LDA-C dependencies by switching to Spark LDA, eliminating licensing issues on this particular branch.Date of last release:.N/A.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?.N/A.Signed-off-by:.
