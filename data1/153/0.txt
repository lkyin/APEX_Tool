The latest release is still 14.3. We are preparing for release of version 1.9. A LOT of good contributions and patched have been submitted to JIRA and the lists are increasingly more active. We/I plan on going through as many contributions and patches in the coming weeks (October/November), reviewing and committing them, and then making a release.
