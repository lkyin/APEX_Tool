TinkerPop is a graph computing framework written in Java.TinkerPop has been incubating since 2015-01-16.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. We need to fully migrate to Apache infrastructure -- Migrating GitHub. to JIRA is all that is left. This should happen next week. 2. We need to get our SNAPSHOT deployment going -- AsciiDoc, JavaDoc, and. SNAPSHOT jars. We have Jenkins works for us, just need to go the final. mile. 3. We need to release 3.0.0.M8. This will be a great milestone showing. that TinkerPop is full-on Apache and producing like a well oiled. machine.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. Everything has been going smoothly since the last report. While the. processes are slower than we would like, they are moving along. Getting. past the infrastructure migration will be a big win for us.How has the community developed since the last report?. We have not grown our committer pool. Currently it is still only Marko,. Stephen, and James. Those individuals that were committers when TinkerPop. was outside of Apache are currently providing pull requests. When we get. past the infrastructure migration process, Stephen and I plan to recommend. a few long term TinkerPop developers to join as committer pool and thus,. grow the developer community.How has the project developed since the last report?. We have migrated from GitHub to ApacheGit. We have migrated our website. from http://tinkerpop.com to http://tinkerpop.incubator.apache.org/. We. have migrated our GitHub presence to Apache GitHub. (https://github.com/apache/incubator-tinkerpop We have prepped our. source code with ASF preamble headers and have gutted all "non-Apache. compliant" dependencies (save for one -- we are working with our mentors. on this Finally, on the development front, the developers are coding. every day.Date of last release:.
