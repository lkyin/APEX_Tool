Jena is a semantic web framework in Java that implements.the key W3C recommendations for the core semantic web technologies of.RDF and SPARQL. Jena entered incubation in November 2010.Progress since the last report:.The project uses the Apache-based developer list exclusively and is now encouraging users to use the Apache-hosted user mailing list by regular reminder and an automatically added a trailer on all messages on the old user list.The Apache-hosted website is "under construction" in staging. The project selected the Apache CMS and buildbot system. The design and navigation is done. Next step is to populate the website with the content from the old sites.One module, LARQ, is being used to learn about the Apache release process and the requirements it brings with it.Important issues to address for graduation:. Create a code base in Apache with legal clearance.There are about 10 small contributions (a few line upto a single class file) across the whole codebase that that need to be resolved. All are currently covered by BSD licences. Do a full release.Issues for the Incubator PMC or ASF Board:.None.Technical development:.The new transactional native SPARQL storage systems, TxTDB has been advertised as a prototype snapshot. Some users have offered to help with testing.Signed off by mentor: rgardler.
