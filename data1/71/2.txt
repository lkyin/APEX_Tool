Description - Buildr is a build system for Java applications written in Ruby.Date of Entry - Nov. 2007.Development.We're working toward Buildr 1.3 which will hopefully become our first Apache release. The main focus of this release is multi-language support with the big addition of Scala. It also opens the door for other languages. The work done around JRuby is also coming to fruition with, for example, the possibility of writing tests with RSpec to run against your Java classes.Community.A very steady stream of patches is coming from a steadily increasing community of users. We've had contributions for EAR support, JRuby, fixes around IDE tasks, . We're monitoring closely the advanced users that submit patches consistently, to see if we can attract a few of them to become committers.Issues before graduation.When 1.3 is ready, we'll have to face all the issues surrounding the release of Ruby code. Hopefully, when all these issues have been ironed out, our main problems will be solved. From then it's business as usual: continuing to build a healthy community around Buildr.
