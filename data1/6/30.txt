Apache Daffodil is an implementation of the Data Format Description Language (DFDL) used to convert between fixed format data and XML/JSON.Daffodil has been incubating since 2017-08-27.Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:.Increase community growth and participation beyond Tresys (main priorityWork with other Apache projects where Daffodil could provide extra functionality (NiFi and Drill are current prioritiesContinue frequent release schedule.Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?.None.How has the community developed since the last report?.Continued mailing lists discussions, with a handful of new faces asking questions on the users@ mailing list, hopefully some of these can be converted to developers.Struggling to get active involvement outside of Tresys. We are actively working with known users of Daffodil to encourage contributions, including virtual meetings and making time to help spin up with the codebase.An outside developer has shown interest in contributing to the code-generation runtime. Hoping to spin up that user shortly and start getting contributions.How has the project developed since the last report?.Released Daffodil 2.5.0.29 commits merged from 5 different contributors.44 issues created, 29 issues resolved, focus was primarily on large features rather than bug burn down.Significant improvement to DFDL schema compilation time.Incorporated SonarCloud static analysis to help verify code quality.Lots of refactoring to improve code quality and type safety.Created a container to streamline a repeatable release process.Looking like next release will be sometime in March.How would you assess the podling's maturity?.Please feel free to add your own commentary.
