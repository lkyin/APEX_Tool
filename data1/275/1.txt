HTrace is a tracing framework intended for use with distributed systems.written in java.HTrace has been incubating since 2014-11.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Continue to grow the HTrace community. 2. Continue to develop and release stable HTrace incubating artifacts. 3. Continue to explore the integration of the HTrace framework into other. Apache products.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. Around January 20th HTrace successfully made the first release whilst in. the Apache Incubator. This was the outcomes of no-less than 10 release. candidates and as many VOTE's. In all every release candidate was very. well managed with HTrace community providing excellent feedback to the. release manager. Rather than then entire 10 release candidate exercise. being a pain point for the community, it appears to have strengthened all. involved. Well done HTrace.How has the community developed since the last report?. It is early incubating days for HTrace. The community has attracted in. particular a new member who is doing a sterling job on a new UI for. HTrace. Additionally it should be noted that the entire. htrace-3.1.0-incubating release effort has certainly brought the existing. community on leaps and bounds.How has the project developed since the last report?. The project has progressed significantly. In fact, it was highlighted on. at least one occasion that documentation supporting a release candidate. should be further clarified/improved due to the dynamic progressive nature. of the HTrace codebase. As an early incubating project this is accepted as. a positive move.Date of last release:. 2015-20-01.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?. ???.Signed-off-by:. (htrace) Jake Farrell.
