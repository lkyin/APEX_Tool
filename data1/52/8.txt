The ActiveMQ community continues to grow as evidenced by the mailing list volumes Each month mailing list volumes continues to grow. Last month we had 574 emails sent to the developer list and 905 email sent to the user list! We have also seen a big increase in the amount of patches and contributions submitted from non ActiveMQ committers.A large amount of development work and community interest has been around the Native clients used to access the Messaging broker. Tim Bish's excellent work on the STOMP c++ client has earned him an invitation to become an ActiveMQ committer. Amazon did a in house c++.client to ActiveMQ and that source code donation was accepted and committed to the source tree.All the source headers in the 2 active branches have be update to comply with the new policies outline at: http://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html.The Apache ActiveMQ 4.0.1 has successfully been released. For more information about the release, see: http://incubator.apache.org/activemq/activemq-401-release.html Development continues on the next 4.1 release. In tandem, the 4.0 branch has continued to stabilize and a 4.0.2 release should be ready shortly.The project has discussed graduating and feels that ActiveMQ is ready and would prefer to become a TLP. Once the 4.0.2 release is completed expect more serious discussions regarding graduation to pop up on the incubator mailing lists.
