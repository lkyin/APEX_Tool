We posted a Woden milestone plan in September covering M1 at end-Sept through to M5 in Jan 2006 Completion of the initial project objective, full WSDL 2.0 functionality, is targetted for M4 end-Nov. M1 was release on Mon 3 Oct and included most but not all of the planned scopd. M3 and M4 will be busy periods. M5 and future plans will emerge as we approach M4 and start thinking about other Woden objectives like WSDL 1.1 conversion and StAX XML parsing for the Axis community. We are using the woden-dev mailing list for communication and discussion and recently held our first conference call - although not all participants could make the call, it helped confirm the Milestone plan and resolve some technical issues. Most of the development is currently being done by 2 committers and this may continue up to M3/M4, by which time we will have a suitable base for others to start building on.
