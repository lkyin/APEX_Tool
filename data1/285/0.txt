MRQL is a query processing and optimization system for large-scale, distributed data analysis, built on top of Apache Hadoop and Hama.MRQL has been incubating since 2013-03-13.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Expand the development community to include more diverse committers. 2. Complete the first release. 3. Create a wiki to document both the software use and the software development process.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?.none.How has the community developed since the last report?.This is the first report for MRQL. We have decided to adopt the review-then-commit policy that requires at least two +1 from committers and no -1 from committer. In addition, we have started the process of creating a new infrastructure for the MRQL podling. We have already created three email lists, mrql-private, mrql-dev, and mrql-user, and we have requested the creation of a new JIRA project and a new wiki site for MRQL.How has the project developed since the last report?.We have restructured the original source code and we have modified the in-file copyright notices of the source code to be compliant with the Apache License 2.0, to make it ready for the first release.Please check this when you have filled in the report for MRQL.Signed-off-by:.Alex Karasulu: [ X ](mrqlAnthony Elder: (mrqlAlan Cabrera: (mrqlMohammad Nour: (mrql.Shepherd notes:.
