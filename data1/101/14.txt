Empire-db is a relational data persistence component that aims to overcome the difficulties, pitfalls and restrictions inherent in traditional Object Relational Management (ORM) approaches Empire-db is on the Apache Incubator since July 2008.After we had completed development activities on release 2.0.5 in July we were hoping to get the release accepted by our mentors the Incubator PMC within a couple of weeks. Unfortunately we first faced the problem that due to vacation time we were not able to get a mentors vote on our PMC. With recommendation of one of your mentors we then decided to move on to the IPMC. Again we did not get many responses at first, but finally we found some reviewers who discovered some incomplete or inconsistent documentation issues and raised some concerns about the content of the distribution files and maven artifacts. After we had corrected these issues and after presenting a new release candidate to the IPMC new issues came up that had not been raised before and in the end it took us 6 lengthy iterations before we finally got our release accepted by the incubator PMC. After the approval of Empire-db 2.0.5 the new release was published in the Maven repository and on our website. Now that the new project structure has been established and approved we hope that the release process of our next release will run a lot smoother and quicker.Meanwhile new plans have been made for our next release where intend to provide a code generator that allows generation of the data model class files from an existing database. For this a new subproject and the corresponding JIRA tasks have already been set up. As such a suggestion has been raised by one of our users, We are hoping to get new users involved in our development team.The project's top 3 things to resolve prior to graduation:.Grow a larger community.Roll out a second maven-based release.Signed off by mentor: ThomasFischer.
