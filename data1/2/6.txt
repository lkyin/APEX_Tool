Annotator provides annotation enabling code for browsers, servers, and humans.Annotator has been incubating since 2016-08-30.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Developer/community engagement/growth. 2. Research and planning. 3. Shipping a "promising demo".Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. None at this time.How has the community developed since the last report?. Minimal mailing list activity. Little from new people. It seems (mostly that folks are waiting on "someone to code something" before they state. opinions, get involved, etc. We've used the wiki a bit--in hopes of getting. feedback/input, but since mailing list folks can't edit/comment by default. there's been lag/disinterest caused by that hurdle being particularly high.How has the project developed since the last report?. The two most active developers (randall & bigbluehat) have a plan (on the. wiki) which they hope to deliver code for before May. There are two events. in May (I Annotate and ApacheCon) which we hope to demo/present at to. increase awareness/interest/contribution.How would you assess the podling's maturity?.Please feel free to add your own commentary. Initial setup. Working towards first release. Community building. Nearing graduation. Other:.Date of last release:. XXXX-XX-XX.When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?. We've not added any new committers since the beginning. We're still waiting. on all the initial committers to join the list and/or participate.Signed-off-by:. (annotator) Nick Kew. Comments:.

Comments:.IPMC/Shepherd notes:. johndament: The podling is about 9 months old, no releases, no new committers. Low mailing list activity. Without starting any growth, I'm not. sure they'll be able to survive.
