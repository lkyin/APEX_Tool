The Yoko community has decided that it's probably best to split the project in two and submit them to be housed as sub-projects of CeltixFire and Geronimo. The WS bindings, and the requisite support tools, of Yoko would move on to CeltixFire with everything else, e.g. ORB and RMI, moving on to Geronimo. A committer roll call was performed and a list of developers still interested with either/both of the two bodies of code. Proposals will be submitted to both the CeltixFire and Geronimo PMCs this month.
