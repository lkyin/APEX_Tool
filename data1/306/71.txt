A wave is a hosted, live, concurrent data structure for rich.communication. It can be used like email, chat, or a document.Wave has been incubating since 2010-12-04.Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:. 1. Growing community. 2. Improving code base.Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be.aware of?. None.How has the community developed since the last report?. The community has several new/re-activated contributors and. participants across different disciplines since last report. The most. significant developments for our community have come about since. September. After an open community conference call on Sept 28th, a joint effort. between Wave and SwellRT development was initiated. SwellRT API has. been tried out by some members of the community and a branch. containing the SwellRT code is now in the repository. Discussions are. still taking place to determine the full extent of the integration as. the projects share a common goal but have side plans as well. SwellRT is a fork of Wave resolving some complexity issues of the Wave. code that have prevented community growth and adoption issues.How has the project developed since the last report?. Some members of Wave community have tried SwellRT API and some common. tasks have been performed, such as:. - Cleaned up some obsolete dependencies. - New branch created on wave repo containing a mirror of SwellRT code. - Updated major dependencies and fixed minor bugs, some taken from. SwellRT. .Date of last release:. March 2016.When were the last committers or PMC members elected?. February 2016.Signed-off-by:. (wave) Christian Grobmeier. (wave) Upayavira.Shepherd/Mentor notes:. Upayavira: . SwellRT appears to be a useful addition to Wave - it was originally. a fork of Wave that has been improved/simplified. The Wave community. still needs to handle IP Clearance for the SwellRT codebase.
