Apache Empire-db is a relational database abstraction layer that allows developers to take a more SQL-centric approach in application development than traditional ORM frameworks. Its focus is to allow highly efficient database operations in combination with a maximum of compile-time-safety and DBMS independence. Empire-db has entered Incubation in August 2008.Activity since last report:.- We have successfully completed and published our 2.1.0 release with few but major improvements.- We have increased your community by taking on a new long-time contributor as a new committer.Important issues to address for graduation:.We still need more contributors and more attention in the Java community. Recently we experience increased traffic on the user lists and there are plenty of plans on the development side. The challenge will be to keep users interested and let them participate in the development process.Signed off by mentor: dashorst.
