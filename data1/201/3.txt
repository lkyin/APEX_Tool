iPMC Reviewers: robertburrelldonkin, mvdbRiver is aimed at the development and advancement of the Jini technology core infrastructure. River entered incubation on Dec 26, 2006.The River community is starting some real work. The initial code submission for the Jini Technology Starter Kit (JTSK) and the ServiceUI API have been filed at the ASF secretary, voted in and landed in SVN, the committers account are in place and the PPMC is set up. No more excuses, now it's time for coding & community!.The discussion is now moving to technical issues and code evolution, which is a very good sign. There has been a discussion about package naming, as the code in SVN is under a non org.apache. namespace:.given the sheer amount of issues with backward compatibility and supporting existing users, there has been a general consensus on getting our feet wet with the current code base, integrate a few patches that have been held off while the code was to be migrated to the ASF infrastructure, and devise a roadmap ( possibly with assistance from general/pmc@IAO) for migration to the ASF namespace:.this is high priority and the community realizes how it might be important to have a decision as soon as possible, even more if River is to publish incubating releases.iPMC questions / comments:.
