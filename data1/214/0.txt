The Solr team has been focusing on preparing its first release candidate out of the incubator, and is getting fairly close: maybe another couple of weeks before we vote All committers and mentors are on the solr-dev mailing list, where discussion has been taking place. All ASF resources (Subversion, mailing list, etc.) seem to have been created and are functioning well. We have also been taking this time to re-think our distro contents, e.g. where to put examples, whether to package Tomcat for an out-of-the-box working webapp, etc: those discussions have been taking place on the solr-dev list, which is public, and everyone is welcome to join.
