The OFBiz team continues to gather individual contributor license agreements (iCLAs) from people who have contributed to the project in the past: this effort is nearly complete, and we expect to import OFBiz code into the ASF Subversion repository soon You can see the progress of getting iCLAs at http://ofbizwiki.go-integral.com/Wiki.jsp?page=OFBizDevelopers.In addition, the OFBiz PPMC has been setup and all initial committers and mentors subscribed to it. OFBiz management discussions have been taking place on that list for a few weeks now.In summary, things are progressing well. No major issues at this time.
