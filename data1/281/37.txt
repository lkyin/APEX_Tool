Kato is a project to develop the Specification, Reference Implementation, and TCK for JSR 326: the JVM Post-mortem Diagnostics API.Recent Activity:. Discussions have been going on with Oracle regarding their participation in JSR 326 and Kato. Initially when the project was started Oracle expressed enthusiasm at participating, however during the acquisition of Sun Oracle was understandably quiet. In more recent times Oracle expressed interest in the project, but this interest hasn't amounted to anything concrete and we've been pushing for Oracle to make a definitive statement regarding it's position on the JSR. .The following is planned for next reporting period:. Without any response from Oracle we will assume that Oracle has no interest in the project, and decide what to do with the JSR and Kato unilaterally. Decide in what form the podling should continue, if at all.Before this project can graduate we need to encourage more participation in the project and grow the community.Signed off by mentor:.
