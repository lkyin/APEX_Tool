We currently have a critical dependency on Hibernate which needs to be resolved There have been several offers to replace Hibernate with Apache License compatible products, including JDO. Craig Russell is actively working on a JDO implemenation that should be able to replace Hibernate. We have just removed one other LGPL dependeny on "FindBugs".While the remaining LGPL dependencies are being resolved, the project has continued to move forward by making releases through the RollerWeblogger.org site, including the 2.0.1 release on 5 January 2006. The release is clearly marked "2.0-incubating". The 2.1-dev codebase is being tested in production at the RollerWeblogger.org site.Aside from dependencies, the biggest issues we have to resolve now are moving the documentation (JSP Wiki) and issue tracking (JIRA) from their current homes to the ASF.Since our last report, we've added another new committer, Matt Schmidt, bringing the tally to seven committers and PPMC members.
