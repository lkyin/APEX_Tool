iPMC Reviewers: jukka, robertburrelldonkin, mvdbApache ODE is an implementation of the BPEL4WS and WS-BPEL specifications for web services orchestration. ODE entered incubation in March 2006.Beside regular development, the principal improvement in ODE for these 3 past months is our first incubator release. We've been able to come up with a valid release after several release candidates reviewed by the ODE committers and got voted by the IPMC. We've also received a very nice contribution from Kelly Thompson for our website with good looking graphics.A steady stream of patches is also coming in (see [1], [2] and [3] for example) and we have a few leads to bring in more committers (Tammo Van Lessen and Jim Alateras) after a couple more patch contributions.We've raised some concerns about the absence of a real PPMC for ODE to the IPMC, result of the lack of activity of some of our mentors. We'd been handling all decisions as a community with all active committers before but our PPMC didn't reflect it. As a result, Niclas Hedhman has volunteered to become a mentor for ODE, Dims and Paul being both active mentors and the PPMC is elected now. We're ready to move on.As a community, once the PPMC issue settles down, we believe we're ready for graduation.[1] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ODE-142.[2] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ODE-139.[3] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ODE-140.iPMC questions / comments:.
