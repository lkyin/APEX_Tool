WSRP4J was transfered from WS to Portals â€” why the lists aren't under the Incubator is a good question The project currently appears to be languishing, if not outright neglected. Almost none of the listed committers (http://incubator.apache.org/projects/wsrp4j.html) appear to be maintaining any presence. I don't know what, if any, work is being done on WSRP 2.0, and if that is being done elsewhere in vendor space, rather than on WSRP4J in the open.
